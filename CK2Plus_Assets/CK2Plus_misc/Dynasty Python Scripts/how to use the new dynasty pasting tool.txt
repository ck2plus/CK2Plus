First up, you need the latest version of Python 3.

To use the script, just double click it (after installing Python 3 obviously).
It will ask you the dynasty names. Press enter after every dynasty. Press enter without typing anything to quit.
Then it will ask you for the cultures for it to be associated with. Press enter without typing anything to quit.

Then, by some abstract Great Old Ones rituals, it will automagically paste those cultures in 01_dynasties.txt. In reverse order, because we're hardcore like that.

NOTE: Make sure there's always an empty newline before you use it. The script will make add one when it's done.
