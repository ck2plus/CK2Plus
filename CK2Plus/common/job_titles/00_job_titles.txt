# COUNCILOR TITLES
##########################################

#	attribute: This attribute is added to the ruler's for governance purposes
#	viceroy: This is the Viceroy title for de jure Kingdoms
#	allow: conditions for the character to hold the title
#	gain_effect: fires when the title is granted
#	lose_effect: fires when a title is lost through most causes
#	retire_effect: fires when a title is lost due to the character stepping down
#	death_effect: fires when a title is lost due to the character dying
#	The other fields are all character modifiers.

# NOTE: Plus has a different implementation of safe guards for negative opinion effect when swapping councillors. I'm keeping our version.
