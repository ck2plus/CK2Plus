# emf_nomad.20 [New Empty County Holder]
#
# on_new_holder_usurpation listener for empty/nomadic provinces that enforces
# the equivalent of the scripted effect emf_cb_nomadic_province_effect upon
# all usurped empty counties.
#
# The scripted effect is still used throughout CBs, because this method needs to
# convert culture/religion _back_ to what it was before the title transfer, and if
# our CB code didn't try to minimize usage of this fall-back method, then
# it's possible that SoA heresy-takeover mechanics could be triggered by some
# conquests when they should not be.
#
# This should be considered the general, catch-all case for ensuring the invariant
# that non-nomadic rulers conquering (or event-usurping) empty counties or nomadic
# rulers of different culture than such a conquered county will always receive a
# county with a new tribal settlement in it (and the province should be the prior
# culture). NOTE: We don't listen to regular on_new_holder, because we don't
# want this behavior for title grants/gains, which should be exempt. Some CBs use
# such methods, so again, a mixed approach is necessary.
