 Generic_legacy_of_breton_independence_desc: "Brittany has never been part of France.  Though we have been ravaged by Franks, Vikings, and the English in the past, we have, thus far, maintained our identity as a people apart.  Let all of our neighbors be aware that Brittany will remain free, the last home of true Gallic traditions."
 Generic_estates_of_brittany: "The Estates of Brittany"
 Generic_estates_of_brittany_desc: "First called in the 14th century, the Estates of Brittany allowed free men from all rungs of society, even the Third Estate, to share their grievances and petition the Duke for redress.  By calling in the Estates, we can vent some of the tension in our lands."

 Generic_breton_catholicism_desc: "The French may have claimed to be the 'eldest daughter of the Church' since the days of Clovis, but their observance is spotty and their fealty to Rome only evident when it suits them.

 Generic_catholicon_desc: "In 1464, Jehan Lagadeuc wrote the first trilingual dictionary, which contained words in Latin, Breton, and French.

 Generic_memory_of_angevin_claims: "Memory of Angevin Claims"
 Generic_memory_of_angevin_claims_desc: "After the collapse of the Hohenstaufen ambitions to dominate Christendom in the 13th century, in 1264 His Holiness Urban IV wisely removed the titles King of Naples and Sicily from the Hohenstaufen portfolio and bestowed them upon our ancestor Charles of Anjou, who also seized the title King of Albania by his own merits. The treacherous Aragonese, citing their marriage into the Hohenstaufen line, stole Sicily from us in 1282 and recently finished their violation of Papal will by usurping the title 'King of Naples' in 1442 away from our Good King René. The legacy of Charles of Anjou has fallen far, but we remember the vast holdings of our forefathers and their claims stretching all the way to Albania and Jerusalem itself."
 Generic_revive_house_of_anjou: "Revive House of Anjou"
 Generic_revive_house_of_anjou_desc: "The senior line of the House of Anjou went extinct in 1435 when Queen Joanna II of Naples passed away. Long live our junior line, the House of Valois-Anjou, fusion of the two greatest houses of France!  Through the fusion of two dynasties, the royal blood of Hugh Capet flows twice over. With a little work and planning, the devious throne-snatching of our Angevin forebears and the military valor of our Valois ancestors can unite to make the House of Valois-Anjou greater than either."
 Generic_composite_monarchy: "Composite Monarchy"
 Generic_composite_monarchy_desc: "Composite monarchy is a technical term for a kingdom that contains different pieces that are governed by their own legal codes and traditions but are nonetheless united under one crown.  Can there be a better description for the Angevin realms? Once upon a time our family had to govern territories from Anjou to Albania. Today, our reach might be somewhat smaller, but the duties of a Duke of Lorraine, a Duke of Bar, a Duke of Anjou, and a Count of Provence are considerably different even when all those titles are held by the same man. By our flexibility in running vastly different realms to one common goal, we placate our subjects and create a whole that is far greater than the sum total of its parts."
 Generic_tarascon_castle: "Tarascon Castle"
 Generic_tarascon_castle_desc: "Completed in 1449 by Good King René, this fortress is one of the mightiest in all Christendom and is one of the finest examples of military architecture of our day. Use it as a fortress, as an armory, as a prison, or just as a recreational chateau for a ruler in need of relaxation."
 Generic_public_weal: "Public Weal"
 Generic_public_weal_desc: "We are not subjects to the Valois of Paris. Sometimes, however, we feel that Paris has forgotten our ancient privileges. Perhaps if we make common cause with other noblemen trying to break out of Paris' grasp, we will find the strength in numbers needed to retain our prerogatives."
 Generic_toulon_dockyard: "Toulon Dockyard"
 Generic_toulon_dockyard_desc: "Our territory is a natural Mediterranean port. The ancient Greeks realized the value of Marseilles when they settled it under the name Massilia at the dawn of memory. While Marseilles can remain the great commercial hub, Toulon would make a perfect place for a dockyard, naval armory, and staging ground for a fleet for our great country."
 Generic_provencal_quilting: "Provençal Quilting"
 Generic_provencal_quilting_desc: "One of the things that distinguishes our tongue from French is the use of 'oc' instead of 'oui' for yes. This can be observed at any hour of the day by people shouting 'Oc! Oc!' when presented with the chance to own boutis, stuffed wholecloth quilts. These distinctive pieces of Provence's heritage can be found in any place in Europe and their quality leaves foreigners swooning. Much like the Angevin holdings have always been a quilt of different peoples and heritages yet still one distinctive whole, the boutis is a glorious metaphor for our beautiful country."

 Generic_expand_viborg: "Expand Viborg"
 Generic_expand_viborg_desc: "The fortress of Viborg sits on Finland's easternmost frontier against the Russian realm.

By expanding the fortress we would make the situation even worse for our enemies."
 Generic_the_fourth_estate: "The Fourth Estate"
 Generic_the_fourth_estate_desc: "Finland has always relied on its fourth estate, the free peasants, for the prosperity of the realm. The peasant class has throughout Finland's history often been powerful enough to challenge the nobles and sometimes even the king himself."

 Generic_settle_middle_finland_desc: "During the 16th Century Finland saw a substantial growth in the area settled by the farming population and this development was actively supported by the crown. While beneficial in the long run it also displaced local Sami and Karelians leading to conflict."

 Generic_hakkapelitta_fin: "The Hakkapeliitta"
 Generic_hakkapelitta_fin_desc: "The Hakkapeliitta were the fearsome Finnish cavalry that Gustavus Adolphus employed during the Thirty Years' War. The name Hakkapeliitta is a Finnish modification of the names that the soldiers of the Holy Roman Empire gave them, stemming from their battle cry 'Hakkaa päälle!', or 'Hack on them!'/'Cut them down!'. The Hakkapeliitta were feared for their sudden and savage attacks that shocked the enemy into submission."
 Generic_the_white_death: "The White Death"
 Generic_the_white_death_desc: "Prepare for a spring invasion if you wish to conquer Finland as you do wish to feel the deadly, cold embrace of the Finnish winter."
 Generic_anjala_conspiracy: "The Anjala Conspiracy"
 Generic_anjala_conspiracy_desc: "A pivotal point to the building of the Finnish Nation was the Anjala Conspiracy. It came as a result of the Swedish King Gustav III's war with Russia in 1788. Viewing the king as a tyrant and displeased with the war many Finnish officers signed the Liikkala note and had it delivered to Tsarina Catherine the Great. The officers condemned the war in the note and declared it illegal and asked for the restoration of the Finnish borders according to the Treaty of Nystad. When King Gustav III learned of this he demanded his officers fight to the last man, but instead of cowering the officers united to issue the Anjala Declaration in which they took responsibility, criticised the attack on Russia and noted they would defend the fatherland if Catherine the Great refused the peace offer."

 Generic_heritage_of_rus: "Heritage of the Rus'"

 Generic_centralized_rule: "One To Rule Them All " 
 Generic_centralized_rule_desc: "The great and mighty Kievan Rus', once centered in our very city, fell apart into countless petty principalities, endlessly fighting among themselves, bickering and unaware of the fact that larger realms were looking at them and considering them to be ripe for the picking. Never again will we allow this. Our new country shall root out any idea of autonomy and mercilessly keep the tightest of grips over all our former domains.

 Generic_bardic_literature: "Bardic Literature"
 Generic_bardic_literature_desc: "By reviving our ancient poetic traditions, we can stand to last the test of time. The best wars are not won often with the sword, but with poetry and prose as well. A revival in the bardic traditions would also allow us to revive the eisteddfod, a grand gathering to which were invited poets and musicians from all over the country. The winner of the yearly eisteddfod is granted a seat in the lord's council. Our poets have kept alive the Welsh spirit and their songs shall inspire us."
 Generic_cyfraith_hywel: "Cyfraith Hywel"
 Generic_cyfraith_hywel_desc: "There are calls to revive the traditional Welsh law of Hywel the Good and the old cantrefi system for governing Wales, each of which was divided into several commotes.

 Generic_unbennaeth_prydain_desc: "'The Monarchy of Britain' was an Old Welsh poem that served as a national anthem for the many medieval Welsh kingdoms. Although the specific composition is now lost, it presumably recounted the exploits of the former kings of the Britons. Reviving a new form of this composition would stoke national pride."
 Generic_economic_revival: "Economic Revival"
 Generic_economic_revival_desc: "Wales had several problems in becoming an economic power.
