EVTDESC_Plus_1200;I already rule the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], but receiving an official [Root.Religion.GetName] coronation will legitimize my standing to my vassals. Now is the time to begin planning what is sure to be a lavish ceremony, attended by all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1200;I must ask [religious_leader.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] first;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1200;A high ranking priest can perform the coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1200;Get me any priest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1200;Someone will do it in my name;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1201;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI am pleased to invite you to my forthcoming coronation at [From.Capital.GetName]. There I will be officially crowned as [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in the sight of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], and your presence would be most welcome.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1201;I will gladly attend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1201;I have other things to do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1201;Send an envoy in my stead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1201;Alas, the war detains me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_1201;Alas, I am far too busy at present;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1202;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI am very pleased to accept your invitation, and will be journeying to [Root.Capital.GetName] shortly to personally attend your coronation.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1203;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nWhile I appreciate your invitation, I am afraid I must decline. I trust my presence at the coronation will not be overly missed.\n\nYours,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1204;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI fear I will not be able to personally attend your coronation. An envoy will be sent to [Root.Capital.GetName] in my stead, to stand as a representative of the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1205;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nWhile I would like nothing better than to attend your coronation, I fear the war in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] demands my full attention and thus I will be unable to get away. I wish you well on this auspicious occasion.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1206;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nI am pleased to have received your invitation. Alas, matters in [From.Capital.GetName] already have my commitment, and thus I will be unable to make the journey to [Root.Capital.GetName] in time to attend the coronation. Please accept my apologies and congratulations.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1207;[coronation_liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is planning a proper coronation in the eyes of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], and will require a [Root.Religion.GetName] priest to perform the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1207;I shall be that priest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1208;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nAs you will be holding a proper [Root.Religion.GetName] coronation, I would be pleased to offer my services in performing the ceremony.\n\nMay [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] watch over you,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1208;[From.GetSheHeCap] may perform the ceremony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1208;I will hold out for someone better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1209;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nI would be more than pleased to have you perform the coronation ceremony. Please accept my eternal gratitude.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1210;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nWhile I appreciate your offer, I believe it would be prudent if someone more qualified performed the coronation ceremony.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1210;This is an insult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1211;Sadly, the outbreak of war in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] means that the coronation festivities will have to be cancelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1212;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nSadly, the outbreak of war in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] means that the coronation festivities will have to be cancelled. My apologies for the inconvenience.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1212;That's too bad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1213;With your untimely death, the coronation festivities will clearly need to be cancelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1213;And I was SO close!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1213;And I was JUST coronated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1214;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nSadly, the untimely death of [From.GetTitledName] obviously means that [From.GetHerHis] coronation must hereby be canceled. We regret the inconvenience.\n\nSigned,\nThe Chancellor of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1215;The [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1215;'I, [From.GetFirstName] of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty, and with the blessing of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], do hereby rightfully assume the crown of the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].'\n\nWith those words does [From.GetSheHe] become [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth, with each of [From.GetHerHis] vassals lining up to bow before [From.GetHerHim] and swear everlasting fealty. It is an impressive ceremony, full of pomp and circumstance, and one that will write [From.GetTitledFirstName] into history. The streets of [From.Capital.GetName] are lined with [From.Capital.Culture.GetName] crowds cheering, with everyone straining to get a look at the important personages that pass by on their way to the forthcoming feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1215;I have never been more proud;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1215;Long live [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1215;I bet the ceremony was nice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1216;With the coronation ceremony finished, the newly-anointed [From.GetTitledFirstName] retired to [From.GetHerHis] castle for the celebration feast. The hall is packed with people: the lords and ladies of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], their wives and husbands, visiting [From.Religion.GetName] rulers and emissaries...it will be a night to remember!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1216;Let the festivities commence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1216;This will be quite the celebration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1217;The coronation feast goes well into the night, and you find yourself frequently spending time with your host, drinking wine and laughing over stories. You leave feeling as if the two of you have gained an excellent understanding of one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1217;I've found a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1218;As the coronation feast continues, you find yourself frequently in the company of [From.GetTitledFirstName], drinking wine and laughing over stories. While you would not have thought so initially, it seems as if the two of you have gained an excellent understanding of one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1219;It was bound to happen. You drank a little too much at the coronation feast, and when you ran into your host you argued over a title they hold which you believe rightfully belongs to you. Heated words were exchanged, to the point where guards had to politely separate the two of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1219;This is not my fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1220;It was bound to happen. [From.GetTitledFirstName] drank too much at the coronation feast, and at one point in the night confronted you. [From.GetHerHisCap] words slurred from drink, [From.GetSheHe] argued with you over a title that you hold which [From.GetSheHe] believes rightfully belongs to [From.GetHerHim]. It caused quite the scene, reaching the point where guards had to politely separate the two of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1220;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1222;You suspected that [challenge_target.GetSheHe] might be at the coronation feast, and sure enough...there [challenge_target.GetTitledFirstName] is, laughing and carrying on. You despise the man, and with a few drinks in you, it occurs to you to challenge him to a duel right here and now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1224;You challenged [From.GetTitledFirstName], but [From.GetSheHe] spluttered excuses regarding how this was a feast and you are both guests and so forth...and declined the challenge, much to his embarrassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1224;The coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1225;A series of shouts arose during the coronation feast, and the guests parted to reveal the culprits: [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] with blade drawn, challenging [From.GetTitledFirstName] to a duel. Both men are ready to fight, and are asking for your leave to settle matters here and now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1225;Absolutely not! This is a feast, not a tavern!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1225;Talk them out of the foolish idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1225;Why not? Some entertainment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1226;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was furious at both of us for daring to ask to duel, all but ordering us out of the feast. We left, more bitter at [From.GetTitledFirstName] than at each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1226;[From.GetSheHeCap] had no right to speak to me in that fashion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1227;[From.GetTitledFirstName] listened to our request to fight, and instead of agreeing took us each aside in turn and spoke to us calmly. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that it would be unfortunate if either of us were hurt, as it would be a breach of hospitality, and begged us to reconsider...and [From.GetSheHe] was right. It was a foolish idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1227;Another time, then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1228;Those at the coronation feast gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledName], overseen by [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetHerHim]self. The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] was stabbed by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] and died!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1228;Most unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1228;The bastard killed me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1228;Ha! [From.GetSheHe] had it coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1228;How scandalous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1229;Those at the coronation feast gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.GetTitledName], overseen by [coronation_duel_host.GetTitledFirstName] [coronation_duel_host.GetHerHim]self. The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] lost the duel and was badly wounded. [From.GetTitledFirstName] is victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1229;There, it is done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1229;[From.GetSheHe] must have cheated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1229;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1230;Those at the coronation feast gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.GetTitledName], overseen by [coronation_duel_host.GetTitledFirstName] [coronation_duel_host.GetHerHim]self. The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] conceded defeat after first blood. [From.GetTitledFirstName] is victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1231;Those at the coronation feast gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.GetTitledName], overseen by [coronation_duel_host.GetTitledFirstName] [coronation_duel_host.GetHerHim]self. The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] was stabbed by [From.GetTitledFirstName] and died!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1232;The coronation feast was going so well...and then you saw [Spouse.GetFirstName]'s lover, there across the room, laughing and as brazen as [Root.GetSheHe] pleased. How could [Spouse.GetSheHe] invite [Root.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1232;[Spouse.GetSheHeCap] does this to spite me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1233;The coronation feast was going so well...and then you saw [From.GetTitledFirstName] staring daggers at you. [From.GetSheHeCap] accosted you in front of your guests, making a scene over the fact your lover was present at the coronation! Eventually [From.GetSheHe] stormed off, but it was an embarrassing moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1233;That could have gone...better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1234;The coronation's festivities are going well...so well, in fact, that the muse has overtaken you. Perhaps an ode to your host, publicly declared for all to hear?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1234;Yes! Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1234;No, I couldn't bear the shame;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1235;At one point in the coronation's festivities, [From.GetTitledName] stands and gets everyone's attention. [From.GetSheHe] delivers a poem in [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s honor...and it is beautiful. Those gathered are moved, and the applause afterwards signifies that this ode will be written down and remembered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1235;Well done, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1235;I couldn't be more pleased;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1235;How fabulous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1236;At one point in the coronation's festivities, [From.GetTitledName] stands and gets everyone's attention. [From.GetSheHe] delivers a poem in [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s honor...and it is terrible. Did [From.GetSheHe] intend to insult [From.GetHerHis] host, or was it an accident? The awkward coughs afterwards signify this moment is best forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1236;Awkward, indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1236;No, this is terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1236;How awful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1238;'To our good host, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], long may [Root.GetSheHe] reign!'\n\n[From.GetTitledName] stands and delivers an eloquent toast in [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s honor at the coronation feast, prompting a round of approving applause from those gathered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1238;Many thanks, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1238;Long may [Root.GetSheHe] reign!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1240;On the night of the coronation feast, it seems everyone wants to dance with you. [From.GetTitledFirstName] in particular, however, seems more interested than most. The way [From.GetSheHe] smiles at you, you suspect [From.GetSheHe] might be interested in more than just a dance with the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1240;Oh, really? Let's see where this goes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1240;A dance is more than sufficient;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1242;On the night of the coronation feast, it seems every [Root.GetManWomanOpp] wishes to dance with you. How tiresome. [From.GetTitledFirstName] winks in your direction, seeming to understand your discomfort. Indeed, you suspect [From.GetSheHe] might understand better than most...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1242;Let's talk in private, [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1242;I'm not interested in [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1244;All throughout the coronation feast, [From.GetTitledName] has done nothing more than make caustic remarks about you when [From.GetSheHe] thinks you're not listening. You're not even certain why [From.GetSheHe] came to the coronation at all, if this is how [From.GetSheHe] feels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1244;Endure it—it's only one evening, after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1244;Confront [From.GetHerHim]—this needs to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1246;As if [From.GetHerHis] drinking weren't bad enough, [From.GetTitledName] managed to make quite the spectacle of [From.GetHerHim]self at the coronation feast, dancing on tables and carrying on until finally [From.GetSheHe] vomited on the floor in front of everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1246;Oh, wonderful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1248;For most of the coronation feast, [From.GetTitledName] acted normally...or as normally as one can expect [From.GetHerHim] to be, perhaps. Then a servant placed the wrong flagon before [From.GetHerHim], and that set [From.GetHerHim] off: ranting and raving, until finally the hall watched in silence as [From.GetSheHe] was escorted away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1248;You could hear [From.GetHerHim] screaming from the halls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1275;The coronation feast finally draws to a close, with [From.GetTitledFirstName] giving a speech to those gathered that is barely heard over the raucous cheering. 'Long live the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]! Long live the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1275;Let's hope so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1275;A fine event, indeed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1291;With your royal coronation just a day away, you can choose a new name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1291;Yes, I will choose a more prestigious name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1291;No, I'm not changing my name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1291;Yes, I will take a traditional dynastic name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_4750;Your Holiness,\nI humbly request that you perform my coronation as [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_4750;I will gladly do it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_4750;I'm too busy, but you have my permission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_4752;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI fear I will not be able to personally attend your coronation. However, please receive my blessings and approval for one of your realm priests to perform the coronation.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_4753;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nWhile I appreciate your invitation, I am afraid I must decline. I trust my presence at the coronation will not be overly missed.\n\nYours,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
