EVTDESC_Plus_150_transit;Finally, an opportunity has arisen to abduct [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] when [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] takes a planned journey from [Root.PlotTarget.Location.GetName] to a nearby town. Shall I tell my co-conspirators to begin their preparations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_150_bed;Finally, an opportunity to abduct [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] has arisen. One of the [Root.PlotTarget.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s personal guard has proven amenable to bribery, allowing for the opportunity to take [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] while [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] sleeps. Shall I tell my co-conspirators to begin their preparations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_150_hunting;Finally, an opportunity has arisen to abduct [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] when [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] goes on a planned hunting trip over a week from now. The perfect chance to catch [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] away from court! Shall I tell my co-conspirators to begin their preparations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_150_carouse;Finally, an opportunity to abduct [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] has arisen. The [Root.PlotTarget.GetManWoman]'s amourous nature has betrayed [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim]--a planned trip to a brothel in [Root.PlotTarget.Location.GetName] will prove the perfect chance, if we move quickly. Shall I tell my co-conspirators to begin their preparations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_150;We must proceed with the plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_150;Not yet, this is too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_151;At last, after having watched our target here in [Root.Location.GetName] for so long, an opportunity for abduction has arisen. I must tell the others at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_151;With luck, this will be over soon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_152;My dear [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nIt seems the opportunity to abduct [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is finally upon us. I ask that you stand ready to make your move. If we fail this chance, it will not come again quickly.\n\nMy thanks,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_155;My co-conspirators send word that they have prepared everything we need to discredit [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]. Documents of [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] corruption have been prepared, and courtiers have been bribed to whisper to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] of [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis]'s incompetence. With [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] reputation in tatters, [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] will find it impossible to hold on to [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] position on the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_155;That position will be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_156;I have found myself the target of a vicious campaign of slander at court. Rumors of incompetence and corruption have undermined the authority of my position, and it seems that even [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] have come to believe them as I have been removed from my position at the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_156;I am ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_157;The attempt to discredit [From.GetTitledFirstName] was a success! [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] has dismissed [From.GetHerHim] from the council and [From.GetHerHis] position is now vacant and ready for me to occupy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_157;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_158;Lately it seems that I have heard nothing but bad of [From.GetTitledFirstName], from whispers of incompetence at court to documents proving [From.GetHerHis] corruption slipped under my bedroom door at night. I refused to believe it at first, but in the end I could not deny the weight of the evidence and was forced to remove [From.GetTitledFirstName] from [From.GetHerHis] position at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_158;It had to be done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_159;I have found myself the target of a vicious campaign of slander at court. Whispers of incompetence and accusations of corruption have been directed at me, but fortunately [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have refused to give them credence and ordered an investigation into the source of the rumors. Although the investigation turned up nothing, my position at court is secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_159;Who could have instigated such an underhanded scheme?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_160;Despite the rumors and accusations directed at [From.GetTitledFirstName], [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] refused to dismiss [From.GetHerHim] from the council and has ordered an investigation into the source of the rumors. Fortunately, the investigation turned up no evidence of my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_160;It could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_161;Lately it seems that I have heard nothing but bad of [From.GetTitledFirstName], from whispers of incompetence at court to documents proving [From.GetHerHis] corruption slipped under my bedroom door at night. I refused to believe the accusations, and ordered an investigation into the source of the rumors. A thorough questioning of the court turned up nothing, but has at least put a stop to the slanderous accusations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_162;I have found myself the target of a vicious campaign of slander at court. Whispers of incompetence and accusations of corruption have been directed at me, but fortunately [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have refused to give them credence and ordered an investigation into their source which revealed the involvement [From.GetTitledName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_162;[From.GetTitledFirstName] will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_163;Despite the rumors and accusations directed at [From.GetTitledFirstName], [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] refused to dismiss [From.GetHerHim] from the council. Even worse, [Root.Liege.GetFirstName] ordered an investigation into the source of the rumors, which turned up evidence of my involvement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_163;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] is not pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_164;Lately it seems that I have heard nothing but bad of [From.GetTitledFirstName], from whispers of incompetence at court to documents proving [From.GetHerHis] corruption slipped under my bedroom door at night. I refused to believe the accusations and ordered an investigation of their source which revealed the involvement of [FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_164;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_170;The tithes and taxes for [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] are on their way to [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] castle and my co-conspirators have bribed the guards not to notice if a chest or two should go 'missing'. Everything is ready for the robbery to proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_170;We'll all be rich!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_171;The taxes and tithes due to me arrived at the castle today and were placed in the treasury. As I was inspecting the chests full of gold, it struck me that there seemed to be fewer of them than what had arrived earlier. A quick check of the treasurer's accounts revealed my worst fears...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_171;I have been robbed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_172;As the taxes were being hauled into the treasury, several large chests full of gold made their way onto the back of a wagon which left the castle unnoticed. The gold is now safely locked away in my treasury and my co-conspirators have all received their share.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_172;Everything went as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_173;I have received my share of the money embezzled by [From.GetTitledFirstName] from [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_174;The taxes and tithes due to me arrived at the castle today. As I was watching the money being carried into the treasury, I noticed some shadowy figures trying to make off with several chests full of gold. I had my guards seize them, and under questioning they revealed themselves to be in the employ of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. What shall be done with my thieving vassal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_174;Throw [From.GetTitledFirstName] in irons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_174;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_174;Forgive [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_175;As the taxes were being hauled into the treasury, my men tried to make off with several chests of gold but were spotted by [From.GetTitledFirstName], who had come out to inspect the process [From.GetHerHim]self. Under questioning they revealed to myself to be in my employ, and now [From.GetTitledFirstName] knows that I attempted to rob [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_175;Retribution is sure to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_180;My co-conspirators have fabricated evidence that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is planning a revolt against [Root.PlotTarget.Liege.GetHerHis] liege. The evidence will discreetly find its way into the hands of [Root.PlotTarget.Liege.GetTitledFirstName], who cannot fail to act on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_180;I will see [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] disgraced!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_181;Word has reached me that [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] has publicly accused me of treason based on evidence found in some documents that were slipped under [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] bedroom door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_181;This must be a scheme to see me arrested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_182;[From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] was completely fooled by the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. It can only be a matter of time before [From.GetSheHe] is arrested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_183;As I rose from bed, I found a small bundle of documents that had been slipped beneath my bedroom door. The documents contained evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s plans to depose me and seize the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_183;I must have [From.GetHerHim] arrested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_184;As I rose from bed, I found a small bundle of documents that had been slipped beneath my bedroom door. The documents contained evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s plans to depose me and seize the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_184;I wonder who sent it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_185;[From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. Although the scheme has failed, at least there is no evidence of my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_186;As I rose from bed, I found a small bundle of documents that had been slipped beneath my bedroom door. The documents contained evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s plans to depose me and seize the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_186;Nothing but lies and slander;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_187;[From.GetTitledFirstName] tried to have me arrested for treason by slipping fabricated 'evidence' under [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s bedroom door, but fortunately [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] caught [From.GetHerHis] agent in the act and now it is [From.GetTitledFirstName] that stands accused of treason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_187;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_188;My agent was caught in the act of slipping the fabricated evidence under [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s bedroom door. Even worse, my involvement was revealed during questioning and now I am the one that stands accused of treason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_188;This is bad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_189;As I was getting ready to sleep, I heard a scuffle from outside my bedroom door. Rushing outside, I found that my guards had seized a cloaked man as he was attempting to slip some documents into the room. Under questioning, he revealed that he was working for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] and that the documents were fabricated evidence intended to turn me against my vassal [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_189;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is the true traitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_195;My co-conspirators have fabricated evidence of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]'s blasphemous conduct and sheltering of heretics. The letter will be sent to [Root.PlotTarget.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] who will be forced to excommunicate [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_195;God will be my judge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_196;Word has reached me that [Root.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] has had me excommunicated based on fabricated 'evidence' of blasphemy and heresy sent to [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] in an anonymous letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_196;God preserve me from these lies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_197;[From.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] was completely fooled by the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s heresy. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been excommunicated and interdict has been placed on [From.GetHerHis] lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_197;It was the will of God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_198;Word has reached me that [Root.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] has received fabricated 'evidence' of blasphemy and heresy sent to [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] in an anonymous letter. Fortunately, [Root.RelHead.GetSheHe] dismissed it as the slanderous lie it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_198;God looks after the faithful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_199;[From.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s heresy. Although the scheme has failed, at least there is no evidence of my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_200;Word has reached me that [Root.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] has received fabricated 'evidence' of blasphemy and heresy sent to [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] in an anonymous letter. However, [Root.RelHead.GetSheHe] not only refused to believe it, but had the messenger questioned until he revealed the sender of the letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_200;It was sent by [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_201;[From.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s heresy. What's worse, [From.RelHead.GetSheHe] had the messenger questioned and found out that I sent it! I have been censured for my 'unseemly scheming' and [From.GetTitledFirstName] knows that I tried to have [From.GetHerHim] excommunicated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_201;This will not help my reputation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_205;My co-conspirators have fabricated evidence that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is planning a revolt against me. I will circulate the evidence among my vassals so that they will support my actions against the 'traitor'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_206;Word has reached me that documents indicting me in a plan to revolt against [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have been circulating through the realm. Though the evidence is obviously a forgery, it seems almost everyone in the realm has been fooled by it, and I fear I am about to be arrested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_206;Who could have done such a thing?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_207;My vassals were completely fooled by the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. I am now free to act against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_208;Word has reached me that documents indicting me in a plan to revolt against [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have been circulating through the realm. Fortunately most of the lords of the realm have dismissed it as the forgery it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_208;I wonder who was behind it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_209;My vassals refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. Although the scheme has failed, at least there is no evidence of my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_210;Word has reached me that documents indicting me in a plan to revolt against [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have been circulating through the realm. One of the forger's agents was caught while handing out the forgeries on my lands, and questioning revealed him to be working for [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_211;My vassals refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. What's worse, one of my agents was caught and questioned while circulating the forgeries, and my involvement has been revealed to all my vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_211;My reputation is ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_215;Success! [kidnap_victim.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has been delivered in a sack to an abandoned keep near [kidnap_victim.Location.GetName]. There [kidnap_victim.GetSheHe] is at my mercy, and no-one can hear [kidnap_victim.GetHerHis] screams. All that remains is to decide what to do with [kidnap_victim.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_215;[kidnap_victim.GetSheHeCap] will give me the [demanded_title.GetFullName], or else!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_215;[kidnap_victim.GetSheHeCap] will name [demanded_vassal.GetTitledName] my vassal, or else!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_215;Bring [kidnap_victim.GetHerHim] to my dungeon--I will decide later;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_215;Now [kidnap_victim.GetSheHe] dies--quietly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_216;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! You struggle, but it is no use--your captors are strong, and it is not long before you find yourself in the dungeons of [From.GetTitledName]. There, [From.GetSheHe] informs you, you shall remain until [From.GetSheHe] decides otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_216;[From.GetSheHeCap] will pay for this outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_217;[From.GetTitledName] recently went missing, and after a frantic search by [From.GetHerHis] guards, it seemed as if [From.GetSheHe] had simply vanished into thin air! Not so, apparently. It turns out [From.GetSheHe] was forcibly abducted by agents of [FromFrom.GetTitledName], who intends to keep [From.GetHerHim] in [FromFrom.GetHerHis] dungeons until [FromFrom.GetSheHe] decides otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_218;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! You struggle, but it is no use--your captors are strong, and it is not long before you find yourself in a dungeon. There, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] reveals [From.GetHerHim]self as your captor, and states you have only to hand over the [demanded_title.GetFullName] to achieve your freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_218;Take it! Just let me go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_218;[From.GetSheHeCap] will get nothing from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_219;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] clearly didn't like it, but then again you left [From.GetHerHim] little choice. The [demanded_title.GetFullName] is yours. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has not told anyone exactly how you got the title, of course, but there are whispers. Even so, what does it matter now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_220;While [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] earlier seemed to have no intention of granting the [demanded_title.GetFullName] to anyone, suddenly [From.GetSheHe] changed [From.GetHerHis] mind and granted it to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]. Could this have something to do with [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s recent unexplained absence from [From.Location.GetName]? No-one appears to know for certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_221;'You will get nothing from me! Do your worst!' [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] spits in your face, refusing to give into your demands...though you can clearly see the fear in [From.GetHerHis] face. The [From.GetManWoman] is brave, evidently. So now what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_221;Now [From.GetSheHe] rots in my dungeon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_221;Now [From.GetSheHe] dies--quietly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_221;I'm not going to kill [From.GetHerHim]! Just...let [From.GetHerHim] go;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_222;'Then you will remain a guest in my dungeon until I decide just what to do with you,' [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] says with a shrug. With that, [From.GetSheHe] leaves, and you are left in the dark and the cold to wonder whether that was the wisest choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_223;After recently vanishing without a trace from [FromFrom.GetHerHis] court, [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s lifeless corpse was discovered soon afterwards on the bank of a nearby river. People throughout [Root.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are shocked by the scandal, which gets worse when it is revealed that [From.GetTitledName] was behind the deed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_224;While [From.GetSheHe] appears torn, it turns out that [From.GetSheHe] cannot, in fact, order your death. [From.GetSheHe] turns and walks out, swearing, and some time later you are discovered by a passing peasant and released. You are unharmed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_224;A relief, but still...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_225;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! You struggle, but it is no use--your captors are strong, and it is not long before you find yourself in a dungeon. There, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] reveals [From.GetHerHim]self as your captor, and states you have only to make [demanded_vassal.GetTitledName] [From.GetHerHis] vassal to achieve your freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_225;Take the vassal, just let me go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_226;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nI cannot tell you the reasons behind my decision. Simply trust that they exist. With that in mind, I have elected to transfer your vassalage to [FromFrom.GetTitledName], effective immediately. May [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] have mercy upon us all.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_227;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] clearly didn't like it, but then again you left [From.GetHerHim] little choice. [demanded_vassal.GetTitledName] is now your vassal. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has not told anyone exactly how this arrangement came to be, of course, but there are whispers. Even so, what does it matter now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_228;While [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] earlier seemed to have no intention of surrendering any of [From.GetHerHis] vassals to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], suddenly [From.GetSheHe] changed [From.GetHerHis] mind and granted [FromFrom.GetHerHim] lordship over [demanded_vassal.GetTitledName]. Could this have something to do with [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s recent unexplained absence from [From.Location.GetName]? No-one appears to know for certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_229;Alas, [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] surprised the kidnappers with the ferocity of [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] struggle, and they were forced to flee when [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] guards came running. While an investigation is underway, currently no-one is aware that you were behind the assault.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_230;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! Outraged, you struggle--well enough that guards come running, and your kidnappers are forced to flee. Sadly, they escaped...meaning you have no idea who was behind this assault on your person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_230;Surely SOMEONE must know the truth?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_231;Disaster! [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] surprised the kidnappers with the ferocity of [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] struggle, and while they fled when guards came running, they were quickly caught. Even worse, the men gave up your name as their employer! You've denied it, naturally, but [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] clearly does not believe you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_232;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! Outraged, you struggle--well enough that guards come running, and your kidnappers are forced to flee. They are quickly caught, and upon questioning give up [From.GetTitledName] as their employer. [From.GetSheHeCap] tried to have you abducted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_235;Tonight may be the night. I spotted [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] going up to [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] rooms alone after an eve of drinking. I doubt [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is in a condition to resist my charms, if I choose to follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_235;It's now or never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_235;I lack the courage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_236;I've observed the comings and going of the target of a particularly romantic plot, and think I can faciliate a private meeting for the two of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_236;Send a message to the plotter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_237;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has contacted me, saying [From.GetSheHe] believes that [From.GetSheHe] can help me meet [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] privately, and in a condition where [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] will almost certainly be unable to resist my charms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_238;The plan was successful. I crept into [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]'s bed, and before [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] could react, I showed [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] what a night with a real [Root.GetManWoman] looks like. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] did not ask me to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_239;It happened rather suddenly. One moment I was alone in my bed, and then the next [From.GetTitledFirstName] was there with me. I was about to cry for the guards, but the things [From.GetSheHe] he did... I did not want them to stop, and I have not wanted to since the night it happened. I cannot stop thinking about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_239;How did that happen? Was I drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_240;My attempts at seduction have failed! [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] not only threw me out of his room, but threatened to have the guards throw me out of the castle as well. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] is not pleased with me, and [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is not the only one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_241;It happened so quickly. One minute I was alone in my bed, and the next I woke to discover [From.GetTitledFirstName] attempting to seduce me. I threw [From.GetHerHim] out in a rage, and threatened to call the guards if [From.GetSheHe] tried anything so outrageous again. The nerve of the [From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_241;Denied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_250;Your shameful adherence to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is an affront to myself and my supporters, and it must come to an end. I hereby demand that you convert to the [From.Religion.GetName], faithfully and in the sight of [From.Religion.GetHighGodName], or we will resort to force of arms to see you dethroned.\n\nSIgned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_250;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] forgive me, I have no choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_250;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_251;Rather than risking civil war tearing the realm apart, I have decided to give in to your demand and convert to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. But this treacherous act of blackmail will not be forgotten...\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_252;Rather than letting civil war tear the realm apart, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has agreed to convert to the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith. Your valuable support in this conflict will not be forgotten, not by myself and not by [FromFrom.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n\nSincerely,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_253;Under pressure from [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] supporters, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to convert to the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_254;Your shameful attempt at blackmail has not succeeded. No matter how many corrupted souls you have enticed to help carry out your plan, I will not give in without a fight. I'd rather die in the name of the true [From.Religion.GetName] faith and defending what is rightfully mine!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_255;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nI have gathered enough supporters to finally take a stand against [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. Either [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] convert to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, or we will rise up against [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] and install a properly [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] in [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] stead. I ask that you either join us now, or stand aside should the matter come to a civil war.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_262A;Unsettling news—while you currently have no proof of it, you are all but certain that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is conspiring with unknown parties to wrest the regency from your grasp. Unless you act soon, [From.GetSheHe] may very well soon succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_262B;Unsettling news—while you currently have no proof of it, you are all but certain that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is conspiring with unknown parties to wrest the regency from [Root.Liege.Regent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. just as you are. If you do not act to stop [From.GetHerHim] now, [From.GetSheHe] may very well beat you to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_262;I will stop [From.GetHerHim], if I can;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_262;I must wait for proof, and not make things worse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_263A;Your scheming to replace [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] as [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent apparently came to [From.GetHerHis] notice, as suddenly you find yourself without access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] at all. Worse, any efforts to bring the matter before the court have evaporated. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has outmaneuvered you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_263B;Your scheming to replace [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] as [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent apparently came to the notice of [From.GetTitledName], as [From.GetSheHe] has somehow not only blocked your access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] but also to the court. You have been outmaneuvered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_264;You acted quickly to block [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], and to ensure [FromFrom.GetSheHe] would have no chance to bring the matter before the court...and you were successful. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] has been outmaneuvered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_265;While you tried to block [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [FromFrom.GetSheHe] somehow managed to get around your efforts even so. If [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is truly scheming against you, [FromFrom.GetHerHis] efforts continue as before, unhindered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_266;At first it seems like [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has become aware of your scheme to take the regency, but [From.GetHerHis] bungling has only infuriated some of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s courtiers and made it more likely that your efforts will come to fruition far sooner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_267;While you tried to block [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [FromFrom.GetSheHe] somehow managed to get around your efforts even so. Worse, you managed to infuriate some of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s courtiers and made [FromFrom.GetHerHis] scheming far easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_268;You're uncertain what's going on in the court, exactly, but you know something is. [FromFrom.GetTitledName] is no longer allowed to see you, and you don't know why...only that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] says it's for the best. Maybe it is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_269;Something is amiss in your court, but you don't understand exactly what. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] came to visit you recently and said that your regent, [From.GetTitledName], is bungling things badly. With any luck, that will soon change and then [FromFrom.GetSheHe] will be around far more. Wouldn't that be grand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_270A;As both [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent and heir, it has not been a difficult matter to get agreement on the idea that perhaps it is time I take over rule of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth. It is not as if [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] is going to get better, after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_270B;With [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] unable to rule, it has fallen to you to ensure things in [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] continue to run smoothly. As such close family to [Root.Liege.GetHerHim], there are many who are willing to see [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] regent become the ruler in truth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_270C;As [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent, it has not been overly difficult to arrange a conspiracy to see you take over rule of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth. The time for the attempt to be made appears to now be at hand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_270;Let us make the attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_270;No, I should abandon this now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_271;While you have slowly assumed more and more of the duties of rulership in [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName], it seems you were unable to convince [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s councillors and lords to take that final step. They have not restricted your powers, but it's clear they'll resist any attempts for you to take control...for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_272;It seems your efforts to take the rule of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] into your own hands were noticed too soon. Several of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s vassals took serious exception to the idea and raised a great furor, and now your attempt is being called both treachery and usurpation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_273;You're not quite sure what all the fuss is, but a bunch of soldiers came in and arrested [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. They said [From.GetSheHe] was trying to take away your throne! What an odd thing to do. It's so large! Where would [From.GetSheHe] put it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_273;I suppose they'll find me another regent, now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_274;Dangerous business is afoot in [Root.Liege.Capital.GetName]: [From.GetTitledName] attempted to usurp [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s titles, and as [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] regent [From.GetSheHe] very well almost got away with it! [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has been arrested, and another regent shall be found for [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] shortly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_275;Success! Your duties as regent have been expanded to the point where the difference between you and [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is a mere formality...a formality which has now been dispensed with entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_276A;Perhaps it was time. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] came to tell you that [From.GetSheHe] would be taking over rule of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] formally, and thus would no longer be my regent. [From.GetSheHeCap] was my heir, so...that's good, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_276B;Dear [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] came to tell you that [From.GetSheHe] would be taking over rule of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] formally, and thus would no longer be my regent. [From.GetSheHeCap] said it was for my own good, and for the good of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]...and you're hardly in a position to disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_276C;Everyone's making such a fuss. You can barely understand it, but it seems [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] rules in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] now, and not you. But that doesn't seem right, does it? [From.GetSheHeCap]'s your regent, not the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]! Yet everyone keeps saying it, so it must be true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_276;I hope being [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] makes [From.GetHerHim] happy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_277A;With [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] no longer able to rule, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has stepped up from being simply [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] regent and heir to ruling [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth. Many consider the move for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_277B;With [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] no longer able to rule, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has slowly transformed from being simply [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] regent to ruling [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth. Despite [From.GetHerHis] close relation to [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], some are calling this an usurpation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_277C;Dangerous business is afoot in [Root.Liege.Capital.GetName]: [From.GetTitledName] has slowly expanded [From.GetHerHis] duties as [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent until the distinction between them was a mere formality...and now that formality has been dispensed with entirely. [From.GetSheHeCap] has usurped the rule of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_280;After many months of effort, you have found several [Root.Culture.GetName] lords in [Root.Capital.County.GetName] who quietly seethe at the rule of [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]...and with some subtle pushes, they could become much less quiet. Of course, this will also give [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s spymaster the best chance to catch you in the act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_280;Let us proceed with this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_280;It's too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_281;Success! The [Root.Culture.GetName] lords have no idea you were the person behind their 'donations'...nor the incidents which have made their rage against [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] all the greater. Now it simply remains to see if this leads to anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_282;Alas, the [Root.Culture.GetName] lords are either too cowardly to speak openly against [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] or their words fall on too many deaf ears. Nothing has come of your efforts in [Root.Capital.County.GetName], but thankfully no-one is aware of your involvement. We will have to wait for another chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_283;Disaster! One of the [Root.Culture.GetName] lords recognized your agent, and evidently believed that you were trying to trick him. He has been complaining loudly in [Root.Capital.GetName], loudly enough that agents of [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] overheard and have pieced together what really happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_284;My [Root.GetLordLady], we have word from an agent in [From.Capital.County.GetName] that [From.GetTitledName] was attempting to incite rebellion amongst the [From.Culture.GetName] peasants--a rebellion that almost certainly would have been directed against your rule. [From.GetHerHisCap] efforts thankfully failed, and we have proof of [From.GetHerHis] deeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_284;Has [From.GetSheHe] gone mad?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_285;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nIt has recently come to my attention that [From.GetBestName] plots against you, and thus I felt it best if you were to be aware of that fact. I trust you will take whatever steps required to protect yourself.\n\nWith respect,\n[FromFrom.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_285;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] is [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s liege -- [FromFrom.GetSheHe] should do something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_285;This is good to know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_286;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI truly appreciate your assistance in alerting me to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s scheme, though as [FromFrom.GetHerHis] liege, I truly hope you will also take steps to deal with [FromFrom.GetHerHis] criminal behavior.\n\nWith gratitude,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_287;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI truly appreciate your assistance in alerting me to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s scheme. It seems I will have to deal with [FromFrom.GetHerHim], and quickly.\n\nWith gratitude,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_288;Unfortunately, it appears that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] has become aware of your plot against [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim]. You strongly suspect that [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s spymaster learned of the plot and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] then revealed it to [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_293;Some guards have been convinced to be 'pre-occupied' for a while. This could be the perfect opportunity to elope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_293;We will elope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_294;Thanks to the guards being distracted tonight you were easily able to slip out to your lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_294;Finally we are together;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_295;After much anxious waiting you finally see your lover approach the meeting spot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_295;Finally we shall be married;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_296;It would seem [From.GetFirstName] has vanished from your court. There are whispers that [From.GetSheHe] has eloped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_296;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_297;Despite your best attempts your liege was sticking unusually close to you tonight and you could not avoid [Root.Liege.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_297;It's almost like they knew...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_298;After waiting for hours at the meeting spot you begin to realize that something is amiss. A discreet messenger arrives from your lover telling you that she could not safely leave to meet you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_298;We'll just have to try again;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_299;You decided to stay out and about more than usual tonight. A strange air lingers around [From.GetFirstName] and the guards were acting a bit off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_299;Perhaps I am being paranoid...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_2900;As you were trying to sneak out the guard captain caught you. It would seem the guards drunkenly revealed the whole plot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2900;My liege will not be pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2901;You've just recieved word that your lover was caught by the guard captain. It would seem your trust in those guards was misplaced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2901;She'll never escape now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2902;Your guard captain approaches you with noticable hurry. He informs you that [From.GetTitledFirstName] just attempted to elope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2902;They will both pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
