EVTDESC_Plus_1500_A;My spies believe they have collected enough information on [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]'s comings and goings that my plot should now have a better chance of success, and indeed should happen more quickly than originally planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1500_B;My spies believe they have collected enough information on [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]'s comings and goings that the plot against [target_spy_on.GetHerHim] should now have a much better chance of success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1501;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nMy people have been watching [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] for some time now, and we've acquired enough knowledge of [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] comings and going to help your plot against [target_spy_on.GetHerHim]. With luck, my information will see us to success.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1505;An interesting bit of information has surfaced from my spying on [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]: the man everyone believes to be [[target_spy_on.GetHerHis] father is not. [target_spy_on.GetHerHisCap] mother, [target_spy_on.Mother.GetTitledFirstName] once had a torried affair with [target_spy_on.RealFather.GetTitledName], and it is he who is [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]'s real father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1505;Blackmail [target_spy_on.RealFather.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1505;Reveal the truth for all to see;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1505;I have no interest in this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1506;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nIt has come to my attention that you are, in truth, the father of [target_spy_on.GetTitledName]. No, there is no need to deny it. I have several letters between yourself and [target_spy_on.Mother.GetTitledFirstName] in my possession. If you do not make it worth my time to keep them to myself, it will be most unfortunate.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1507;It seems you leave me no choice. To protect both my own reputation and that of [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName], It seems I must do as you demand.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1508;You believe I am concerned that anyone might know of [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]'s true lineage? I have borne scandal before. Do your worst, fiend, you shall see no profit in this deed.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1508;Then it seems everyone must know the truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1508;Bah! Fair enough, I'll not go through with it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1509;News has been circulating throughout court that [Root.Father.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is not, in fact, your father. They say [target_true_father.GetTitledName] is, and, true or not, it seems everyone believes the scandal. You have been declared a bastard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1509;How can this be??;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1510;News has been circulating throughout court that [target_spy_on.Father.GetTitledName] is not, in fact, the father of [target_spy_on.GetTitledName]. [target_true_father.GetTitledName] is, having once had a torried affair with [target_spy_on.Mother.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], the child kept a secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1510;Such a scandal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1515;My spies have uncovered some interesting information on [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]: [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] was recently seen in the company of [target_revealed_lover.GetTitledName], and I'm assured the two of them are clearly lovers and have been for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1515;Blackmail [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1515;Blackmail [target_revealed_lover.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1515;Reveal them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1515;I have no interest in this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1516;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI am aware of your affair with [target_revealed_lover.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. Unless you would like this knowledge to be made freely available to the world, I suggest you make my silence worthwhile, and soon.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1516_B;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI am aware of your affair with [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. Unless you would like this knowledge to be made freely available to the world, I suggest you make my silence worthwhile, and soon.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1516;Pay [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1516;[From.GetSheHeCap] will get nothing from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1517;What you believe you know is barely worth clarifying. Here is coin enough to keep your silence, wretch, for I have not the time to deal with the scandal your wagging tongue would cause.\n\nTake it and go,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1519;Do your worst, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. I have not the time to spend on your imaginations, and certainly will not reward you for making threats.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1519;Reveal [From.GetHerHis] affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1519;Let the matter drop;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1525;Your spies have recently overheard [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] saying some rather unflattering things about [target_new_rival.GetTitledName]. Considering that [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] also has no love for [target_spy_on.GetHerHim], it might be possible to enflame a rivalry between the two without anyone being the wiser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1525;Make the attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1525;No, I don't want to risk it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1526;Success! A few rumors spread in the courts of both [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] have resulted in their mutual dislike blossoming into a new rivalry. Now all that remains is to see where this leads...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1527;You've never cared for [target_new_rival.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is constantly filled with rumors of the terrible things [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] has been saying about you. It is beyond the pale, and enough is enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1527;How dare [target_new_rival.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1528;You've never cared for [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is constantly filled with rumors of the terrible things [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] has been saying about you. It is beyond the pale, and enough is enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1528;How dare [target_spy_on.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1529;While you've filled the courts of both [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] with rumors, neither of them seems to have taken the bait. At best, they are irritated with each other. Thankfully, neither has clued into the fact that the rumors have come from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1530;You've never cared for [target_new_rival.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is filled with constant rumors regarding how much [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] dislikes you. Even so, you find it hard to credit this talk as more than just talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1530;I so despise court gossip;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1531;You've never cared for [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is filled with constant rumors regarding how much [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] dislikes you. Even so, you find it hard to credit this talk as more than just talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1532;Alas, while you've filled the courts of both [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] with rumors, neither appears to have taken the bait. Worse, their suspicions that someone is behind these rumors has been raised. Your hand may have been revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1533;You've never cared for [target_new_rival.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is constantly filled with rumors of the terrible things [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] has been saying about you. It turns out, however, that the rumors are false and come from [From.GetTitledName], who has been attempting to stir a rivalry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1533;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1534;You've never cared for [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is constantly filled with rumors of the terrible things [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] has been saying about you. It turns out, however, that the rumors are false and come from [From.GetTitledName], who has been attempting to stir a rivalry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1540;Your spies report that [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is not on good terms with [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] liege, [target_new_rival.GetTitledName]. Indeed, it might be possible to plant rumors and sour relations between them even further...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1541;Success! Rumors planted in the courts of both [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] have stirred up animosity between them both, with neither aware that you are the one responsible. Now it only remains to see what comes of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1542;While you have no great love for your liege, recently you've heard far too many rumors regarding how much [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] dislikes you. You were disinclined to believe them, but the way [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] glared at you at your last meeting has persuaded you otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1542;So that's how it is, is it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1543;While you have no great love for [target_spy_on.GetTitledName], you had no idea that [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] despised you so much until you began hearing rumors of [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] hateful comments. When you last saw [target_spy_on.GetHerHim] at court, the glares [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] shot your way confirmed your suspicions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1544;While you planted rumors in [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court regarding [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], they have been lost amidst all the hubbub of [target_new_rival.GetHerHis] daily duties and thus were ignored. Thankfully, neither [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] nor [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] are aware of your attempt to cause trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1545;Alas, while you planted rumors in [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court regarding [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], they have been mostly ignored...and, far worse, you believe they have begun to suspect your involvement in starting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1546;There have been far too many rumors lately regarding [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s supposed dislike of you...enough so that you were prompted to investigate, only to discover rumors that you hated [target_new_rival.GetHerHim] as well! The rumors were spread by [From.GetTitledName], who is evidently attempting to cause trouble between you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1546;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1547;There have been far too many rumors lately regarding [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s supposed dislike of you...enough so that you were prompted to investigate, only to discover rumors that you hated [target_spy_on.GetHerHim] as well! The rumors were spread by [From.GetTitledName], who is evidently attempting to cause trouble between you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1550;Through constant prayer and dedication to virtue, all the stress you feel has started to...simply melt away. Perhaps this is the peace a simpler life entails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1550;I shall renew my dedication to God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1551;It has taken time, but your devotion to prayer and virtue has lifted the dark clouds from your thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1552;You have come to realize that your devotion to drink is, in itself, a form of gluttony that simply cannot be abided. The time for abstinence has come, as difficult as it will be on your system after so many years of excess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1553;You have devoted yourself for so long to your pursuit of saintly virtue, sometimes it feels as if you make almost no progress at all. But you are getting there, slow as the path might be. You can feel yourself drawing closer to God with each passing day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1553;God forgive me my impatience;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1554;It seems as if you have been walking the path to saintly virtue forever. Can it really be achieved, or is it all some lie peddled by the priests to the gullible? Doubt besets you, and you feel your resolve slipping despite your continued dedication to prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1554;I will not give up! I must not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1555_fail1;It is too much. Setback after setback has beset you, and it seems more and more unlikely you will ever achieve saintly virtue as you desire. It pains you to admit, but the time has come to give up on your ambition -- you are simply not the [Root.GetManWoman] of God you'd hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1555_fail2;You have literally spent years on the path to saintly virtue, but you admit to yourself there are still flaws in your character that cannot be ignored. You are a sinner in your heart, and that baser part of you cannot be banished no matter how much you try. Sadly, the time has come to give up your ambition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1555;I simply cannot do it any longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1556;You have spent years upon the path to saintly virtue, years spent banishing your inner demons and focusing exclusively on prayer and devotion to duty. The time has finally come to realize you have achieved your goal -- you are considered far and wide to be a [Root.GetManWoman] of God and a paragon of Christian piety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1556;I am but a servant of God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
