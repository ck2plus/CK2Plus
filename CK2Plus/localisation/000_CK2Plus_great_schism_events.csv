# Text
PlusGreatSchism_005_text;The inevitable has finally occurred: a delivery of a bull of excommunication to [b_hagiasophia.Holder.GetTitledName] by [k_papacy.Holder.GetTitledName] has been responded to in kind. The mutual excommunication follows on the heels of what is reported to be a series of terse letters over Christian doctrine, each building on the growing divisions between Latin and Greek Christianity. While few are treating the event as noteworthy at the moment, the reality of the situation is that Rome and Constantinople have grown apart to the point where any hope of reconciliation has been completely lost. They have, in truth, become two separate faiths operating under their separate religious heads, despite the Pope's and the Ecumenical Patriarch's assurances to the contrary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Text, also used for 062
PlusGreatSchism_061_text_1;At the behest of [council_holder.GetTitledName], an ecumenical council is to take place at [council_location.GetName], one which many believe will end the Great Schism which has divided the western and eastern branches of Christianity once and for all. [target_religion1.GetTitledName] is said to be arriving, as is a horde of priests, patriarchs, and senior members of both the [mender_religion.Religion.GetName] and [target_religion1.Religion.GetName] faiths. Unlike previous councils, there is a feeling that the Great Schism may actually be resolved -- indeed, with the influence that [council_holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] holds amongst the faithful, it may very well be that the [target_religion1.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] has no choice but to agree to the council's resolutions even if the result would turn [target_religion1.GetHerHim] into a virtual heretic. [target_religion1.Religion.GetName] rulers across the world are already considering whether they must submit to this new order of [mender_religion.Religion.GetName] dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PlusGreatSchism_061_text_2;At the behest of [council_holder.GetTitledName], an ecumenical council is to take place at [council_location.GetName], one which seems ready to finally resolve the Council of Ephesus from the 5th Century -- that historic event which originally repudiated Nestorianism and caused the creation of the Church of the East. [target_religion1.GetTitledName] is said to be arriving, as is a large number of priests, patriarchs, and senior members of both the [mender_religion.Religion.GetName] and [target_religion1.Religion.GetName] faiths, almost too many for [council_location.GetName] to contain. With [council_holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s influence backing the council, it is believed the Nestorians will be brought into the [mender_religion.Religion.GetName] fold, something even the [target_religion1.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] will likely have no choice but to agree to even if this will turn [target_religion1.GetHerHim] into a virtual heretic.

## Pope appoints Holy Roman Emperor
# Title
PlusGreatSchism_071_title;Two Roman Emperors?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Text
PlusGreatSchism_071_text;[Root.GetTitledName] has invoked the translatio imperii, and been given the blessing of Pope [Root.RelHead.GetFirstName] as the ruler of a Roman Empire reborn. This naturally does not sit well with [e_byzantium.Holder.GetTitledName], who maintains that the Pope does not have the right to bestow such a title. Indeed, the Pope doing so could imply either that [e_byzantium.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is not the *true* Roman [e_byzantium.GetRulerTitle] or that [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has some manner of authority over [e_byzantium.Holder.GetHerHis] realm. Either way, Greek bishops throughout Europe are furious, seeing this as yet more evidence of the Pope's attempts to establish primacy despite the Council of Chalcedon having clearly placed Constantinople as the seat of Christianity's highest ecclesiastical court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

PlusGreatSchism_072_title;The Erosion of Christianity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Text
PlusGreatSchism_072_text;With the war currently ongoing between [Root.GetTitledName] and [papal_emperor.GetTitledName], questions have begun to rise about the unity of Chalcedonian Christianity. [papal_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] was crowned by the Pope, was [papal_emperor.GetSheHe] not? Does that not make [papal_emperor.GetHerHim] the Pope's champion? Yet here [papal_emperor.GetSheHe] stands, at war with the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] who stands at the center of the eastern Christian faith. Divisions between Latin and Greek Christians have been deepening for years, but this war brings into sharp focus just how bad things have become. More and more, bishops on both sides are talking about a coming schism that could rend Christianity in two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

## Rome adopts Filioque
# Title
PlusGreatSchism_073_title;Adoption of the Filioque;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Text
PlusGreatSchism_073_text;'And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,\nwho proceeds from the Father and the Son,\nwho with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified.'\n\nThe original Nicene Creed, established at the First Council of Nicaea in 325AD, did not have the phrase 'and the Son' added to 'who proceeds from the Father'. This is referred to as the Filioque, and by the decree of Pope [Root.GetFirstName] it has been added to the creed used by Latin bishops, to underline the importance of the Son in the Trinity...and reoundingly rejected by the vast majority of Greek bishops, who are furious that the Pope did so without calling an ecumenical council. To most, this is yet another example of the growing division between Greek and Latin Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

## Jurisdictional dispute over the Balkans
# Title
PlusGreatSchism_074_title;Papal Jurisdiction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Text
PlusGreatSchism_074_text;A recent rare meeting between [k_papacy.Holder.GetTitledFirstName] and [b_hagiasophia.Holder.GetTitledFirstName] in Constantinople to discuss the ecclesiastical jurisdiction over [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] was said to end in near-chaos, with [k_papacy.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] storming out of the cathedral in a fury. The Pope claims that [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] falls within [k_papacy.Holder.GetHerHis] rightful domain, while [b_hagiasophia.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] claims [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has never been part of either ecclesiastical realm, and that this is yet another example of the Pope striving to assert primacy where it is not warranted. This latest conflict over papal jurisdiction has left both patriarchs almost unwilling to communicate at all, a fact which has left many of their bishops extremely worried.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The priests complained, outraged, and their anger spread to other Latin realms, resulting in a series of sweeping edicts against several Greek practices.
