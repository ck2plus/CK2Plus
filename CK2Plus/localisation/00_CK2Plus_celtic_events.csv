changeling_child_acts_strange;[From.GetFirstName]'s behavior concerns you sometimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_Plus_806;It is the dead of night when a sudden chill comes upon you. You open your eyes and sit up only to see [From.GetFirstName] standing at the foot of your bed staring at you in complete silence. After rubbing the sleep out of your eyes, you look again and now there is no sign of the child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_Plus_806;[From.GetFirstName] is sitting on the floor, playing with [From.GetHerHis] toys when something dark suddely seems to come over the child. While spasming wildly, [From.GetFirstName] cries out in a tongue foreign to you and looks wildy about, looking for shelter from.. something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_Plus_806;An inhuman wail interrupts your sleep, and you hurry outside with your sword. On the ground in front of the castle you find [From.GetFirstName] running around in circles around a burning fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_806;Was it a dream?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_806;That can't be a good sign...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_806;[This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] help me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_Plus_809;The corpse of [changeling_victim.GetTitledName] was discovered today at the bottom of a steep ravine with a broken neck. It seems to have been a tragic accident ordained by the gods, but strangely, [From.GetFirstName] was seen standing next to the ravine, peering down into it just before the tragedy was revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_Plus_809;[changeling_victim.GetTitledName] was found impaled on a wooden fence just outside your courtyard this morning. You can only deduce that [changeling_victim.GetSheHe] fell on the fence from the roof of your stable, though what business [changeling_victim.GetSheHe] had up there you cannot fathom. Poor [From.GetFirstName] was the first one to lay eyes on the gruesome scene...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_Plus_809;[changeling_victim.GetTitledName] was found stuffed head first into a barrel full of rain water this morning, with only [changeling_victim.GetHerHis] pale, rigid legs visible above the surface. Your guards speculate that [changeling_victim.GetSheHe] tripped, somehow fell into the barrel and then tragically drowned. [From.GetFirstName] was found playing just nearby, but doesn't seem to have seen anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_809;Curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_809;Yes, an interesting coincidence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_809;Yes...I suppose it could have happened that way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_812;[changeling_trade_druid.GetTitledName] ambushes you as you leave your personal grove and speaks to you in a pleading voice. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has clearly been taken by the Fairies and replaced with a changeling. We must try to perform a trade, there is no other way. I won't lie - the child may not survive the ordeal. Nevertheless, we must try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_812;Perform the ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_812;If you so much as touch [changeling_child.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#The Changeling Trade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_813;The druidic ritual to contact the fairy court has begun. The child is brought to a raised platform in a grove where [changeling_child.GetFirstName] awaits surrounded by chanting maidens. You are not permitted to witness the sacred ritual itself, so you depart the grove and wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_813;[This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] preserve us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_Plus_815;The chanting from the grove comes closer and [changeling_trade_druid.GetTitledName] appears together with [changeling_child.GetFirstName], flanked on either side by singing maidens. The child looks shaken, but otherwise unharmed. It is done, [changeling_trade_druid.GetFirstName] announces. The child has been saved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_Plus_815;The incantations from the grove suddenly stop, and several maidens, their white gowns red with someone else's blood, run past screaming. Fearing the worst you hurry back, but when you reach the platform you find only the butchered remains of [changeling_trade_druid.GetFirstName]...and [changeling_child.GetFirstName] laying unconscious next to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_Plus_815;A solemn procession of maidens led by [changeling_trade_druid.GetTitledName] finally emerges from the grove, but there is no sign of [changeling_child.GetFirstName]. It is done, [changeling_trade_druid.GetFirstName] announces. The changeling has been sent back...but I fear there was no way to save the child. The Sidhe are fickle beings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_Plus_815;The chanting from the grove comes closer and [changeling_trade_druid.GetTitledName] appears together with [changeling_child.GetFirstName], flanked on either side by singing maidens. The child's vacant stare hints that something is wrong. It is done, [changeling_trade_druid.GetFirstName] announces. The changeling has been sent back, but the struggle was great. I fear it has left scars on [changeling_child.GetFirstName] that may never heal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_815;Thank the gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_815;[This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] preserve us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_815;Then your life is forfeit as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_815;Leave while you still can, [changeling_trade_druid.GetFirstName], and never return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_815;You have my thanks...it had to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_816;You have known since you were a child that you were not fully...normal. The druids say that you were switched as a child and that your strange disposition is due to your otherworldy nature. You are a changeling, half human and half fairy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_816;It is my time now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Divination;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_827;I don't know why I bother;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_828;What nonsense;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
