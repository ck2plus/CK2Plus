EVTDESC936;Try as you might, your efforts to expand the network of spies throughout [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has met with nothing but problems, as of late.

EVTDESC944;You have been sent into [Root.Location.GetName] by [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to calm the peasantry when your patrol happens across a group of angry rabble.

EVTOPTA_20356;All that trouble for nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_20356;Well, at least I did some damage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20357_nothing;It's quite laughable. [FromFrom.GetTitledName] made an attempt to ferret out your various spies and informants, but [FromFrom.GetHerHis] attempt was so bungling all it did was reveal [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to you.

EVTDESC20359_med;A number of your informants in [Root.Capital.GetName] have recently gone missing, simply vanished without a trace. It's clear that someone has been attacking your network, but, whoever they are, they're skilled enough to keep themselves hidden from your spies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC39625;Bad news. It appears [From.GetTitledName] was discovered secretly preaching in [convert_province.GetName] by [convert_province.Owner.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s guards and now languishes in a [convert_province.Owner.Culture.GetName] prison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA39625;Unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME39656;[Root.Liege.GetLordSpiritualName] Found and Captured;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39656;You are traveling through [convert_province.GetName] when you are suddenly beset upon by [convert_province.Owner.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s guards and captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50000;My friends have come up with a daring plan to break me out of prison. Do I dare to make the attempt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50000;It's too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB50000;Freedom is worth any risk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD50002;Off with [From.GetPossPronoun] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50900;I deserve my freedom. I should offer to pay a ransom for my release.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50900;Make my request;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50901;My prisoner, [From.GetBestName], is offering to pay a ransom for [From.GetHerHis] freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA50901;Accept the ransom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB50901;Let [From.GetHerHim] rot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55001;I have become strongly attached to the culture of [Root.Capital.GetName], dressing and speaking almost like a local.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55001;I feel like a [Root.Capital.Culture.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB55001;It is a passing fancy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55002;For as long as we have ruled here, we have entrusted the raising of our children to Saxon nursemaids. Our first words would not be French but Saxon. As we grew up we learned to speak a tongue that was neither one nor the other. Now is this time to make this tongue our own so we may all communicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55003;Around our lands more people are using this English language and I find this is a perfect means for a [Root.Culture.GetName] overlord to get his Saxon serfs to work properly. We continue to use our own influence to promote this means of communication in the interests of more efficient realm. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55100_muslim;Your Tribal vassal, [From.GetTitledName], has adopted the Iqta system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC60001;My liege, the great Khagan has dispatched a numberless horde of barbarian horsemen against the lands of Central Asia and the Far East. Appearing in Balkh, the heathen armies seem intent on conquering the Muslim world, but could potentially range much further before their strength is spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60001;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] have mercy on us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME60002;The Death of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60002A;The great [Root.GetTitledName], leader of the Mongol Empire, has died. According to his last wishes, he has split the mongol horde into three parts: one in the north to be led by [first_mongol_son.GetTitledName], one in the south to be led by [second_mongol_son.GetTitledName], and the remaining lands in Transoxania to be led by [third_mongol_son.GetTitledName]. All of the western world waits with bated breath to see if these brothers will begin a renewed siege upon their lands, or whether they will fall into infighting and civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60002B;The great [Root.GetTitledName], leader of the Mongol Empire, has died. According to his last wishes, he has split the mongol horde into two parts: one in the north to be led by [first_mongol_son.GetTitledName], and one in the south to be led by [second_mongol_son.GetTitledName]. All of the western world waits with bated breath to see if these brothers will begin a renewed siege upon their lands, or whether they will fall into infighting and civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60002;This is how it shall be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60002;A great leader has passed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC60002;Hopefully this means a reprieve is at hand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60003A;With the passing of the Khagan, you are now given the option of serving one of the new leaders: [first_mongol_son.GetTitledFirstName] of the Golden Horde, [second_mongol_son.GetTitledFirstName] of the Ilkhanate, or [third_mongol_son.GetTitledFirstName] of the [third_mongol_son.PrimaryTitle.GetName] Horde.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60003B;With the passing of the Khagan, you are now given the option of serving one of the new leaders: [first_mongol_son.GetTitledFirstName] of the Golden Horde or [second_mongol_son.GetTitledFirstName] of the Ilkhanate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60003;I shall serve [first_mongol_son.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB60003;I shall serve [second_mongol_son.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC60003;I shall serve [third_mongol_son.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60004;With the passing of your [GetFromFromRelation], you have been chosen to lead the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] and have been granted the lands and vassals accordingly. As per your [GetFromFromRelation]'s wishes, this means giving up your claims on the other lands...but it also means a chance to establish a dynasty in your own name, one that will take the legacy of your [GetFromFromRelation] and build upon it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60004;Long live the Khagan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME60010;The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] Converts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD60201;I am fine where I am;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC60208;Now that you have established your empire, most of the men under your command have taken up positions within your court and returned to their homes, eager to reap the rewards of their time spent in your campaigns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA60208;So must it be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC62912;We intend to settle this new land, and that means bringing as many of our people from across the Carpathian Mountains as we possibly can. We leave behind our old lands, it's true...but let the mongrels have it. Hungary is our domain, now, and it shall be an empire to inspire our ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_62912;Long live Hungary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC62913;With [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s departure from our lands, all that is left are those of the [Root.Culture.GetName] people who did not care to move on. We will remain and forge a new destiny of our own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_62913;That we shall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64200;I have grown increasingly attached to [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], and though our marriage was merely a practical arrangement I wonder if I have now come to love [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64200;This is a marriage of love;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64200;But all the other girls!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC64200;But all the other boys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD64200;I am not ready to commit fully to [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC68010;A Thieves' Guild has been established in [Root.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA68010;They have not stolen any of my property yet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC68011;Thanks to my tireless efforts, the Thieves' Guild in [Root.GetName] has been eradicated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA68011;It is good to be the [Root.County.Holder.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC68020;A Smugglers' Ring has formed in [Root.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA68020;I don't see how this matters to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC68021;Thanks to my tireless efforts, the Smugglers' Ring in [Root.GetName] has been destroyed. The head of the last smuggler is now rotting on a pike outside the city gates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA68021;I am such a great [Root.County.Holder.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC68030;Bands of robbers are roaming the countryside in [Root.GetName], killing and stealing. They are too craven to attack my castles though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA68030;I am safe inside my walls..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC68031;I have rounded up and executed the robber bands that were plaguing [Root.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA68031;Call me [Root.County.Holder.GetTitledFirstName] the Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC70000;I will watch from the stands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD70000;I will not be attending;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA70001;I will be taking my place among the fighters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC70001;I look forward to watching from the stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD70001;I will fight in the tournament myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC70998;The war has forced an unfortunate end to the tournament. We shall have to begin again once victory is achieved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72011_nerthus;Dear [Root.GetBestName],\nI hereby invite you to the grand feast in [From.Location.GetName] that will be held in the honour of the Journey of Nerthus. Your presence at the holy feast would be greatly appreciated, and I look forward to your attendance.\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72015_nerthus;The guests have finally arrived! All is ready: the cooks have worked day and night preparing the food for the holy feast, the priests have prepared the rites, and the castle has never looked lovelier. Nerthus would be pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72075_male;I made sure the most handsome man would be my dinner partner and during the feast I kept refilling both our wine glasses. My charm and my winning smile made it impossible for him to stay unresponsive, and it didn't take long until he looked at me with more than interest in his eyes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72077;The night of passion [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I shared was certainly exceptional. Come the next day, however, I must determine if there is, in fact, anything more between us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB73200;Best not to annoy [Root.Liege.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74998;War disrupts our summer fair. We are forced to cancel our activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC75114;[From.GetTitledFirstName] believed me when I told [From.GetHerHim] I had never even talked to the girl who accused me of raping her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88283;Riders have been sent to all the corners of the land, spreading word that the grand Furusiyya tournament will soon be held. All knights are expected to attend, and all others will be invited to witness the spectacle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA88283;Praise be to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC88251;The grand tournament known as the Furusiyya begins, and the coming two months shall separate those gifted with the skills of a warrior from those who would only pretend at such.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91350;My [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], has let me know that my sinful living shames the entire dynasty in [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. [FromFrom.GetSubjectPronounCap] is exerting [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] influence to shield House [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName], but strongly urges me to seek guidance in the perfect example set by the Prophet (peace be upon him).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC91351;My decadent [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], refuses to change [From.GetPossPronoun] sinful ways. I can declare [From.GetObjectPronoun] a kafir, which will give me a reason to exile the degenerate... unless there is another way to get through to [From.GetObjectPronoun]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB91360;I must join the [join_holy_order.GetFullName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA91352;Good, House [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] must stay pure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC92000;I fear that the long years of peace have made me complacent and decadent. Where once I would long for the sounds of battle and the glory of victory, I now prefer the comfortable, easy life of luxury in my palaces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA92000;Perhaps I should contemplate a new campaign?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100170;The friend of a friend is my friend - a motto I try to live by and sometimes that is an easy truth. I was recently introduced to [friends_friend.GetTitledName] through my friend, [my_friend.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], and immediately felt a connection to [friends_friend.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100171;I recently introduced [start_friend.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to [friends_friend.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], and had high hopes. They are both my friends, after all, and I hoped they might hit it off and befriend each other, as well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100171;...alas, [start_friend.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] didn't care for [friends_friend.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] at all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB100171;...and, sure enough, they had a great time together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC100171;...unfortunately, I don't think that's going to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD100171;...but they didn't, sadly, and just ended up irritating each other;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100172;[start_friend.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] was introduced by a mutual friend, [my_friend.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], and we talked for quite a while. We had our differences and a few arguments, then we found common, safe ground and I began enjoying myself. [start_friend.GetSheHeCap] seems like a decent person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100173;After I talked to [start_friend.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and discovered we had next to nothing in common, and that [start_friend.GetSheHe] was a horrible [start_friend.GetManWoman], I wanted nothing to do with [start_friend.GetHerHim] ever again! Our mutual friend, [my_friend.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], wasn't happy, but understood I wouldn't ever be friends with [start_friend.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB100174;Sadly, [friends_friend.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] didn't feel the same way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100411;Though I had thought [From.GetTitledFirstName] to be a more reasonable man, [From.GetHerHis] request to be allowed to duel [From.GetHerHis] rival [duel_rival.GetTitledFirstName] was slightly... erratic. [From.GetTitledFirstName] claimed to be constantly subject to affronts from [duel_rival.GetTitledFirstName] and asked for permission to defend [From.GetHerHis] honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME320500;New Farming Techniques;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320500;With the help of the local aldermen, I have implemented new and improved farming techniques in [Root.Location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320500;My liege will be pleased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320501;My liege, I bring good news from the province of [From.Location.GetName]. In my research, I have come across new farming techniques which would increase the crop yield of the peasants' fields. With the help of the local aldermen, these techniques have now been implemented across the province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME320502;Peasant Obstructionism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320502;My efforts to improve the economy of [From.Location.GetName] have been hindered by peasant obstructionism. They are up in arms for what they believe to be a scheme to raise their taxes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320502;My liege won't be happy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320503;My liege, I regret that I must be the bearer of ill news. In my research, I have come across new farming techniques which would increase the crop yield of the peasants' fields. Despite the best of intentions, my attempts to implement these techiques have been met with suspicion and hostility from the local peasants, who are up in arms for what they believe to be a scheme to raise their taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320503;Foolish peasants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC710000;The Jewish Community that I am sheltering has prospered and grown under my benevolent rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA710000;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC710001;My liege, I bring news from the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. The Jewish merchants that you wisely allowed to settle in the city have grown fat and prosperous under your benevolent rule, and you can expect increased revenue from the taxes and tariffs imposed on their community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA710001;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC710003;A skilled advisor from the Jewish Community I am sheltering has made his services available to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC710004;A group of Jewish refugees from distant lands have come to my court. They are seeking a new a place to live after being expelled from their former homes and ask for my permission to establish a community in one of my cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA710004;They are welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB710004;Tell them to move on;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC710005;[From.GetTitledName] has decreed that all Jews in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are to be expelled from the realm and their assets seized by the crown. This includes my own Jewish subjects, who I have no choice but to banish unless I want to openly defy my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB710005;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ancrel_2575;You have been approached by a group of Hellenic priests who have offered you initiation into the Orphic Mysteries, a cult dedicated to the mythical poet, Orpheus, who descended into the Underworld to retrieve Persephone through his charm. Becoming a member would be a significant honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ancrel_2575;I will gladly join;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ancrel_2575;I'm not interested;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ancrel_2576;You have been approached by a group of Hellenic priests who have offered you initiation into the Sybilline Mysteries, a cult dedicated to the goddess Cybele—also known as the Great Mother—and her ancient oracle at Delphi. The cult is well known for its stewardship, and membership would be an honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ancrel_2577;You have been approached by a group of Hellenic priests who have offered you initiation into the Mysteries of Serapis, a cult dedicated to the Greco-Egyptian god that supplanted Osiris in renown and power. The cult is well known for its martial prowess, and membership would be an honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ancrel_2578;You have been approached by a group of Hellenic priests who have offered you initiation into the Mysteries of Despoina, the unnameable goddess and part of the eternal cycle of life and death.

EVTDESC_ancrel_2579;You have been approached by a group of Hellenic priests who have offered you initiation into the Mysteries of Trophonis, the ancient figure from whom the saying 'those whom the gods love die young' originates, and who has come to represent wisdom.

EVTNAME_ancrel_2580;The Initiation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ancrel_2580;Three days later, you are blindfolded and brought down into a dark cavern, and there you take part in the ancient and secret rites of initiation with fellow members of the Mystery—those who are now your brothers and sisters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_ancrel_2581;The Mithraic Mysteries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ancrel_2581;You wake suddenly one evening, a bag thrown over your head, and struggle helplessly as you are dragged away. You awake in a dark cavern, surrounded by men in dark robes and a single priest standing below the statue of a great bull. They all hold wicked-looking knives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ancrel_2581;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ancrel_2582;The hooded priest below the bull statue addresses you. 'Know that you have been found worthy of the Mysteries of Mithras, that which is above all others. Accept and you will be initiated into the lowest rank, but can rise. Refuse...' The glint of flame on his blade indicates his deadly meaning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ancrel_2582;Accept the great honor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ancrel_2582;Run for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ancrel_2583;Those who rank highest within the Mysteries gather in the mithraeum, hooded and unknowable. They listen intently as you describe the feats that you believe have earned your place among them. After a time, the high priest stands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_CM_11;Far from their ancestral steppelands, the Bolghars have over the centuries slowly but steadily adopted more and more Slavic and Roman traditions. In the province of [Root.GetName], the people have now gone so far as to start considering themselves properly Bulgarian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CombatTraits_1;This war, this opportunity to prove my mettle in combat, has opened my eyes to my true potential as a warrior. My personal combat skills are improving...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CombatTraits_110;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetBestName], just earned XP from a combat impulse at the age of [From.GetAgeYears] with the CTA ambition [From.GetAmbition] (Martial: [From.GetMartial]).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CombatTraits_111;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetBestName], just earned XP from a combat impulse at the age of [From.GetAgeYears] (Martial: [From.GetMartial]).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CombatTraits_112;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetBestName], was victorious in a duel against [FromFrom.GetBestName] and earned XP (Ambition: [From.GetAmbition]).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CombatTraits_113;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetBestName], was victorious in a duel against [FromFrom.GetBestName] but did not earn any XP (Ambition: [From.GetAmbition]).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CombatTraits_114;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetBestName], leveled-up [From.GetHerHis] combat trait (Ambition: [From.GetAmbition]).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CombatTraits_13;My combat victory against [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] was an insightful challenge to my own tactics. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] moved differently than I've come to expect and demonstrated a new, effective combat style to me. At no point was my victory certain, but I learned from [FromFrom.GetObjectPronoun] and finally defeated [FromFrom.GetObjectPronoun]. Certainly, I'm now a finer warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CombatTraits_2;I've learned many lessons from this battle. Aside from application of the theoretical tactics my mentors taught me as a [Root.GetLadLass], I've learned to deftly isolate an opponent in the thick of the front, bring all my focus and concentration to bear upon him, and then, within but a few rounds of melee, swiftly execute him. I'm proud of my clear progression into a greater warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CombatTraits_20;You asked [Root.Educator.GetTitledFirstName] to teach you how to fight better with a sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CombatTraits_21;Under my guidance, my young [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], is slowly mastering the art of swordsmanship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CombatTraits_22;The sword in my hand seems heavier and heavier every year...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CombatTraits_3;I will remember this battle in its finest detail until the end of my days. [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] guided my sword into the hearts of a countless number of my foes, raising cheers and battle-cries from my surrounding men as I cut a path through the enemy. My mastery of personal combat has come a long way. Apparently, I am not the only one to think so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DuelEngine_10;You and [combatant_1.GetBestName] recover from the furious fight, and are ready for another round. You scan [combatant_1.GetHerHim] to see if [combatant_1.GetSheHe] is getting tired yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DuelEngine_105;You easily break through [round_loser.GetBestName]'s guard and knock [round_loser.GetHerHim] to the ground. [round_loser.GetSheHeCap] lies sprawled at your feet, completely at your mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_DuelEngine_107;[round_loser.GetBestName] drops [round_loser.GetHerHis] weapon and throws up [round_loser.GetHerHis] hands. 'Yield! I yield!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_DuelEngine_107;[round_loser.GetBestName] drops [round_loser.GetHerHis] weapon and tries to flee, but you overhaul [round_loser.GetHerHim] easily! Exhausted, [round_loser.GetSheHe] drops to [round_loser.GetHerHis] knees and throws up [round_loser.GetHerHis] hands. 'Yield! I yield!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_DuelEngine_107;Your blow leaves [round_loser.GetBestName] motionless on the ground, but as you approach you can still hear [round_loser.GetHerHis] ragged breaths: [round_loser.GetSheHe] lives, but may never wake again. You stand above [round_loser.GetHerHim] and...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DuelEngine_108;[round_winner.GetFirstName] lowers the point of [round_winner.GetHerHis] weapon and extends a hand. 'I accept', [round_winner.GetSheHe] says, 'back on your feet.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DuelEngine_109;[round_winner.GetFirstName] looks down at you without a hint of emotion on [round_winner.GetHerHis] face.\n'No.'\nAll goes dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DuelEngine_11;You and [combatant_1.GetBestName] are getting ready to cross arms yet another time. Surely [combatant_1.GetSheHe] must be nearly beaten now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DuelEngine_110;[round_winner.GetBestName] strikes, but you roll to dodge just in time, taking no more than a flesh wound. You force yourself back to your feet and hold your weapon ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DuelEngine_111;You strike, but [round_loser.GetBestName] rolls to the side, wounded but still very much alive. [round_loser.GetSheHeCap] rises to [round_loser.GetHerHis] feet and readies [round_loser.GetHerHis] weapon once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_FemRule_120;While some might consider it inappropriate for a [Root.Religion.GetName] woman to bear arms, my knowledge of martial affairs and training with the blade have made me the equal of any man. I must now consider whether this is a path I intend to pursue in the years to come, or whether I will put aside such things for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_120;This is my path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_120;I will be a proper [Root.Religion.GetName] woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_125;I have been taught to fight with the blade and to lead men into battle. This is an honorable pursuit for a [Root.Religion.GetName] woman, and I can devote myself to such a path knowing [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] smiles upon me. Some say, however, that the role of a wife and mother should be my focus instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_125;I shall be a wife and mother, no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_135;It has come to your attention that [From.Liege.GetTitledName] is training [From.GetTitledFirstName] in the art of combat. This is highly inappropriate for a young woman of [From.Religion.GetName] faith—perhaps she needs a new tutor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_135;Offer the [From.Liege.GetTitle] my services;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_136;[From.GetTitledName] has offered [From.GetHerHis] services in tutoring [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], suggesting it is inappropriate for a [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] girl to spend her time training with swords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_136;Perhaps this is for the best;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_136;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] will be raised how I see fit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_138;My dear [This.GetTitle], your offer is deeply appreciated. I am afraid [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] will continue to be tutored by her current guardian until I see fit to do otherwise.\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_138;A foolish decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_140;Age and poor health are wearing on me. If I am honest, it is time I realize I cannot serve as my liege's champion any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_140;I must inform [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] of the bad news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_141;I have received a letter from [From.GetBestName], informing me that he is no longer able to serve as my champion. Age and ill health, it seems, have gotten the best of him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_141;Sad news indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_145;I believe I would be a better champion for my lady liege than the man she currently favors with the title. Perhaps I should ask it of her?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_145;The honor should be mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_145;I'm not interested in being champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_146;A letter has arrived from [From.GetBestName], saying that he is ready and eager—and more than qualified—to be my new champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_146;I accept [From.GetHerHis] gracious offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_146;I would rather keep my current champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_146;No, and do not ask me again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FemRule_146;I want no further petitions of this kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_147;My liege and lady, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is evidently not entirely happy with my performance as her champion. I hear that she has considered a petition from another who claims to be a better warrior than I, and thus better able to defend her honor. So far, however, I have heard nothing on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_147;I must try harder to be worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_147;If she chooses to replace me, then so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_150;The day of the hunt has come! This is a wonderful chance for the court to venture to the countryside, indulge in fine weather, and allow the men to engage in their bloody sport.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_150;What fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_151;We've had such a delightful time together, chasing after the men on their horses, marveling as they try their best to impress both of us. I think I may have found a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_151;I value this new friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_151;It won't outlast the hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_152;She has been such an irritant on this hunting trip, with not a single good word to say and always taking up the attention of the hunters. Does she not know who I am?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_152;How dare she ruin my hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_152;I will grit my teeth and hold my tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_200;A great tournament, the like of which is not seen every year, has been announced in our realm! You are invited to watch it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_200;Of course, I MUST be there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_200;My faithful champion will represent me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_200;Watch? I will show them my mettle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FemRule_200;No, I will not attend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_201;As [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s champion, you are expected to defend her colours in the great tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_201;I will bring my lady the prize!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_202;Your champion, [From.GetTitledFirstName], died of wounds sustained during the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_203;Your champion, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has been crippled in the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_204;Your champion, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has been injured in the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_205;Your very own champion, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has won the grand tournament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_205;Celebrate with a large feast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_205;A discrete celebration will suffice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_206;Your very own champion, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has taken second place at the tournament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_207;Your very own champion, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has taken third place at the tournament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_210;All the men are looking at me and all the other ladies are jealous of me! I feel justified in my pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_210;Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_211;I'm receiving a lot of attention, but I won't let it get to me. We all have our virtues and our vices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_211;I am humble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_212;This tournament is wonderful, there are so many people to talk to! I've met so many new friends already...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_213;There are so many strange people here, I don't feel at ease around them. Just now, a woman I have never seen before tried to strike up a conversation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_213;But, my lady, we haven't even been introduced!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_214;Not everyone here seems to appreciate my honesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_214;But I'm only telling the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_215;The ladies here are so easy to fool. I could tell them that in Cathay the sky is green, and they would believe me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_215;The poor gullible fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_216;Some of the knights here are really dreamy. If one of them were to proposition me, I think I would swoon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_216;Youth must have some dalliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_217;Some of the ladies here let their heads be turned by a pretty face and a dashing joust, but not I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_217;My honour is safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_218;I may have been admitted into the tournament, but I keep hearing jeering whispers behind me. It seems some of the men here think I'm unworthy of competing in their martial games.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_218;I can't wait to get my revenge in the melée;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_218;Let them talk...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_220;The lords and ladies assembled here have long argued over who is the fairest, but the tournament's champion has crowned me with a wreath of flowers, as the most noble, graceful, and beautiful lady present!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_221;The lords and ladies assembled argued over who is the fairest, but in the end it was Lady [From.GetFirstName] who was crowned with a wreath of flowers as the queen of the tournament, declaring her the most noble, graceful, and beautiful lady present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_221;How dare they! I deserved the crown!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_221;Of course SHE wins it. They would never pick me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_221;She deserves it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_222;There was much discussion at the tournament about which lady had the most grace, nobility, and beauty, but finally it was decided [From.GetTitledFirstName] was the fairest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_226;You've seen Sir [From.GetFirstName] joust and train for the tournament, and must admit he is quite an attractive fellow. Perhaps...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_226;Give him a signal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_226;Nothing good could come of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_227;I always seem to bump into [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetSheHe] holds my eye for just a little too long before looking away. As if [From.GetSheHe]'s expecting something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_227;I should speak to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_229;Sir [From.GetFirstName] approached me when we are a little apart from the crowd. I think I've made a catch! I'll ask him to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_229;...joust with a token of my favour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_229;...accompany me to see the musicians and singers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_229;...show me how to hit a bullseye on the archery range.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FemRule_229;...get out of my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_230;I keep trying to attract [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s attention, and he keeps ignoring me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_230;Sigh. So much for that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_231;Lady [From.GetFirstName] tied her scarf around my arm and I took to the lists to joust...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_231;...unhorsing my opponent in the first pass!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_231;...but was knocked off my horse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_232;Lady [From.GetFirstName] wanted to see the musicians and singers who came from afar to our tournament. I walked her to see them, and then I undertook to impress her by...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_232;...composing a love ballad which met with general approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_232;...dancing, but I stepped on her foot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_233;Lady [From.GetFirstName] wanted me to teach her archery, so we headed to the tournament range and I...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_233;...showed her so well, she hit the bulls-eye;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_233;...couldn't hit the target myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_234;I thought Lady [From.GetFirstName] fancied me and approached her alone, but she shooed me off laughing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_234;Obviously a case of female hysteria. Obviously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_235;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is truly fascinating, and has been nothing short of attentive and charming throughout the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_235;We should see each other again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_235;I'll leave my bedroom door ajar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_236;Sir [From.GetFirstName] seemed charming, but he embarrassed himself when we were in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_236;I'm never speaking to him again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_236;Maybe I should try and know him better before judging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_236;I'll still leave my bedroom door ajar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_237;Lady [From.GetFirstName] and I seemed to be getting on so well, when she told me she never wanted to see me again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_237;I've been dumped? ME?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_238;[From.GetTitledFirstName] discretely led me to believe [From.GetSheHe]'d be waiting alone in [From.GetHerHis] bedroom tonight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_238;...and I'll go to [From.GetHerHim], of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_238;...that's not going to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_238;...I'll show her how courtly love is better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_239;Lady [From.GetFirstName] suggested we continue our courtly romance after the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_239;I'm already writing her a poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_239;I don't think that's a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_239;I'd rather stay friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_240;Sir [From.GetFirstName] has rejected any suggestion of a romance between us, the cad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_240;I hate him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_241;As I'd expected, Sir [From.GetFirstName] discretely came to my room tonight while I was there alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_241;*pant* *pant*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_242;Sir [From.GetFirstName] has sworn he'll stay true to me, though leagues may separate us, people surround us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_242;This is love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_243;Sir [From.GetFirstName] is sorry, but he only wanted to be friends, he wasn't looking for love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_243;Friendship is good too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_243;You...you can't friend zone a woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_245;All good things have an end, and the grand tournament is over. You got to see the jousts, the melee, the archery contest and mingle with all the lords and their ladies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_245;A jolly fun time was had by all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_246;Unfortunately, the tournament has been canceled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_246;But I was having fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_300;Since you have no living sons by [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], her former titles have been returned to her upon your death and will instead pass to her heirs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_300;I suppose it is only right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_301;Since you have no living sons by [From.GetTitledFirstName], on his death your former titles have been returned to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_301;I should hope so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_302;Since [From.GetTitledFirstName] has no living sons by [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], on his death the titles that he had gained through the right of Jure Uxoris have now been returned to her and shall pass to her heirs instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_302;Perhaps she will marry more carefully this time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_303;Since you have no living sons by [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], by right the titles that he once stripped from you have been returned and will fall instead to your heir rather than his.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_303;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_304;Since you have no living sons by [From.GetTitledFirstName], the titles you once stripped from her by right of Jure Uxoris will instead fall to her heir rather than yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_305;Since [From.GetTitledFirstName] has no living sons by [Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], the titles he stripped from her by right of Jure Uxoris fall to her heir rather than his.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_305;It seems only fair, doesn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_310;The titles you stripped from [From.GetTitledFirstName] through the right of Jure Uxoris were yours only as part of her dowry. As a result of your divorce, those titles are thus legally returned to her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_310;Damnable woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_311;As a result of the divorce between [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], she now legally regains the titles stripped from her by right of Jure Uxoris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_312;My dear husband,\nPerhaps you thought I would not notice if you handed my titles off to someone else? Considering your claim to them is by right of our marriage, with the express intention that it would pass to a child of our union, anything else means they return to me. They are part of my dowry after all, yes?\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_360;My overbearing husband, [From.GetFirstName], has been constantly interfering in the rulership of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and has of late grown beyond the merely opinionated. The garrison in [Root.Capital.GetName] has already begun to defer to his word before mine. Sadly, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s laws support him, and he could usurp my rule if I am not careful. What shall I do? Who can I turn to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_360;I will turn to my lover;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_360;I will turn to my family;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_360;One of my faithful councillors can help me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FemRule_360;Perhaps my good friend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_FemRule_360;[From.GetFirstName] has enemies, does he not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_FemRule_360;There is nothing I can do, and no-one to turn to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_361;My beloved [From.GetFirstName] informs me that her domineering husband, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], is attempting to usurp her rights in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. She does not know what to do, and has turned to me for help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_361;I will go to her at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_361;I shall deal with the cur myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_361;Alas, I cannot help her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_362;Oh no! My hot-headed lover has decided to take matters into his own hands! He intends to ambush [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] and kill him, no matter who sees it or the damage to our reputation! Alas, it is too late to send him a message...all I can do is wait and hope for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_362;What if something happens to him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_363;You are out hunting with a few trusted companions, when - suddenly - the forest is filled with the lethal twanging of crossbows firing from hidden locations. You try to spur your horse to safety, but too late, a bolt slams into your ribcage and knocks you from the saddle. The last thing you see is [From.GetTitledFirstName] gazing down upon with grim satisfaction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_364;You are out hunting with a few trusted companions, when - suddenly - the forest is filled with the lethal twanging of crossbows firing from hidden locations. Thankfully you avoid harm, and when [From.GetTitledFirstName] rushes out at you with sword drawn, you match his blows. After a brief fight, you wound him and he is forced to flee. A close call indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_364;[FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s doing, no doubt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_365;You ambushed [From.GetTitledFirstName] while he was out riding with only a few trusted companions - all scythed down like wheat by hidden crossbowmen. You could not help but feel a grim satisfaction as you stood over the dying [From.GetFirstName] and watched him breathe his last, knowing he would never threaten your beloved [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName] again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_365;Serves him right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_366;It's over. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] ambushed and killed [From.GetTitledFirstName], just as he said he would. While the threat of usurpation is over, everyone knows what [FromFrom.GetFirstName] did...and they all believe that you were behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_366;Oh, you foolish, foolish man...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_367;Everything did not go according to plan. [From.GetTitledFirstName] not only survived the ambush, he also bested you in a swordfight, injuring you in the process. You fled, cursing his name, and he set his men after you. Whatever happens, you will not tell him of [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName]'s involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_368;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] ambushed [From.GetTitledFirstName], just as he said he would, but it was no use. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] was wounded and fled, and now [From.GetTitledFirstName] has the sympathy of your vassals as well as a strong suspicion regarding who was behind it all. You are left with no recourse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_369;Your liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has approached you with an urgent problem: her boorish husband, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has begun to enforce his will in her domain. Indeed, the right of Jure Uxoris means he may very well usurp her titles out from under her unless something is quickly done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_369;I shall go to her at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_369;She is on her own in this matter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_370;My dear [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has sent me an urgent letter. It speaks of her boorish husband, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], and how he is enforcing his will in her domain. Indeed, unless something is quickly done, he may very well usurp her titles through the right of Jure Uxoris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_370;I will go to [From.Capital.GetName] with a large retinue to protect her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_370;I will go to her personally;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_370;She is on her own in this matter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_371;I received a letter from my friend, [From.GetTitledFirstName], with unfortunate news: her husband is preparing to usurp her domain, and the laws of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] appear to support him. She begs me for help, or all is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_372;Here's an interesting thing: [From.GetTitledName] has contacted me, saying that her husband is preparing to usurp her domain through the right of Jure Uxoris. Knowing of my long-standing rivalry with [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], she begs for my intervention to stop him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_373;You receive the worst news. Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], writes to tell you that there is nothing [From.GetSheHe] can do to stop your husband. You are on your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_373;I really thought [From.GetSheHe] might help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_374;Good news! Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], not only came to [Root.Capital.GetName], [From.GetSheHe] brought a number of soldiers and advisors to help you. [From.GetSheHe] says [From.GetSheHe] cannot stay long, but these men should help keep [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] in line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_374;Oh, happy day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_375;I only stayed in [From.Capital.GetName] for a little while. However, I left a behind a few advisors and hardened retainers to keep an eye on [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] in my absence. My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], said she feels much more secure and thanked me profusely. Hopefully this will be enough to prevent further trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_375;We shall see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_376;An obstacle to my plans has arisen: [FromFrom.GetTitledName] recently visited [From.GetFirstName], leaving behind a group of faithful retainers and advisors—all more capable than [From.GetFirstName], and clearly instructed to stymy my efforts. Unless I deal with them, I will not be able to take [From.GetFirstName]'s titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_376;There is nothing I can do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_376;I will kill them all, if I must;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_376;Clever subversion is called for;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FemRule_376;I will win them over with my charm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_377;It has been a week since [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s retainers came to [Root.Capital.GetName], and since then I have seen little of [From.GetFirstName]. He sulks, frustrated, but there is little he can do. It seems my rule is safe, at least for the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_377;This is a great relief;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_378;You endured the swaggering and arrogance of your wife's new allies for a few days. Then, one day while they were out hunting, you tracked them down with a dozen of your most vicious hired swords. The fighting was murderously brutal, yet surprise was complete, and the victor was never in doubt. Now nothing can stop you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_379;You endured the swaggering and arrogance of your wife's new allies for a few days. Then, one day while they were out hunting, you tracked them down with a dozen hired swords. Unfortunately, they had somehow learned of your intentions, and were ready and waiting. The fighting was murderous, but never truly in doubt. Thankfully, you escaped with your life. Another attempt will not be possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_380;Your wife's new allies have no true loyalty to her, that much is obvious. Clever as they are, they are still subject to the weaknesses of most men. A few bribes, some well-timed blackmail, and some subtle threats from your hirelings is all it takes to make them bend to your will. Now there is nothing to stop you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_381;Try as you might, you just can't seem to find a weakness among your wife's new allies. The few you can bribe are quickly dismissed, and the others catch onto your scheme far faster than you would like. Before long, any interaction with you becomes hostile. There will be no getting around them, now. Your plan is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_382;Although your wife's new allies were initially suspicious towards you, your charm and chivalrous nature won them over. Before long, you were laughing and drinking with them in the [FromFrom.Capital.GetName] brothel, and they were openly questioning the purpose of their mission. Perhaps [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] would be better off with you in charge? Now there is nothing to stop you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_383;You were determined to show [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s retainers that you were a superior ruler, in whose hands your wife's dominions would truly be best served. Unfortunately, what you assumed to be a lordly bearing came across to them as laughably arrogant. Soon, they were sniggering behind your back and swaggering about in ridiculing imitation. Your plan is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_384;I don't know how he did it, but somehow [From.GetFirstName] has managed to circumvent the new retainers. They are nowhere to be seen, and he is swaggering around my castle in [Root.Capital.GetName] as if he already owns it. Perhaps I should resign myself to the fact that he does.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_384;That sneaky bastard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_385;[From.GetTitledFirstName] responded to your letter quickly, arriving at [Root.Capital.GetName] alone and listening intently to your tale of woe. [From.GetSheHeCap] frowned at your mention of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s behavior, and came up with a plan to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_385;...find and intimidate anyone supporting him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_385;...use bribery to eliminate his supporters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_385;...drum up popular support among your vassals;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_386;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] recently visited [From.GetFirstName], and [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is clearly the one responsible for the campaign of intimidation that is making your supporters drop like flies.

EVTDESC_FemRule_388;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] recently visited [From.GetFirstName], and not long after your supporters began to waver. Too late you learn that [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is bribing and blackmailing many of them, causing others to run for the hills. You try to salvage the situation, but it's no use. [From.GetFirstName] has won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_FemRule_391;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] recently visited [From.GetFirstName], and not long after you learned [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was touring the countryside, visiting vassals and drumming up support for [From.GetFirstName]. Whatever they thought to do, it failed. Many of the vassals are laughing at her expense, and you're laughing along with them. It was a nice try, feeble as it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_392;[FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s plan worked. Already [From.GetFirstName] is seen far less around [Root.Capital.GetName], and when he is it is spent sulking. You have no illusions that he might not try again someday, but for now [From.GetFirstName]'s ambitions have been ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_392;What a relief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_393;It worked. You went to [FromFrom.Capital.GetName] and came up with a plan to stop [From.GetTitledFirstName] from taking over [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s lands, and while your efforts won't win you any favor with the man they did stop his ambitions cold. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] was incredibly grateful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_394;It was not enough. [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] did what [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] could, but [From.GetFirstName] caught wind of the plan too quickly and was able to counter it.

EVTOPTA_FemRule_395;I'm sorry, [FromFrom.GetFirstName], I did what I could;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_396;You can tell that [From.GetFirstName] is not pleased, but there is nothing more she can do. No-one else can help her, and the laws of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are clearly on your side. By the right of Jure Uxoris, her titles are yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_396;It is done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_397;The principle of Jure Uxoris states that a husband owns the titles of his wife by right, and the laws of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] support it. Thus [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has stepped forward and demanded [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s titles become his—and he cannot be denied. As of today, he has officially usurped his wife's lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_397;What? This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_397;If that is how it must be, I will not oppose it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_398;You begin exerting more and more influence in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. You supercede [From.GetFirstName]'s commands, and give orders to the guardsmen...and you can tell they are almost relieved that a man is doing so.

EVTOPTA_FemRule_398;Let's see what she does...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_100;For quite some time now you have watched the steady decline of the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion.

EVTNAME_GoPagan_225;The Cleansing Ritual;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_225;You approach a set of 6 holes about two feet deep for the ritual. The closest three are filled with gomez (consecrated bull’s urine, an effective ancient sanitizer). The furthest three are filled with water. There is a holy fire on the far end and you come to the realization that the priests are waiting for you to begin the ritual. As you recite Yasna 49 with the priests and approach the first gomez filled hole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_225;I praise Thee, O Mazda Ahura, in my hymns and expect enjoying what Thou deemest the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_226;Choosing the Shekhinah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_226;The Manichaeans believed there were five 'Shekhinah', which are the elements where the Divine dwells. Each Manichaean can choose an element upon which to focus, and once chosen that focus cannot be changed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_226;I will focus upon Haunâ, or Reason;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_226;I will focus upon Madde'â, or Mind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GoPagan_226;I will focus upon Reyana, or Intelligence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_GoPagan_227;I will focus upon Tar'îtâ, or Understanding;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_228;The New Archegos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_228;After the Manichean Archegos was murdered by the Caliph in Baghdad, many thought that was the end of the religion as an organized church. But like a phoenix rising from its ashes, [new_manichean_leader.GetTitledName] has been proclaimed the new Archegos by [Root.GetTitledName], with the Manichean faith having enough power now to make him no mere charlatan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_228;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_228;And so the heresy grows more powerful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_229;The Army of Light;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_229;The growing power of the Manichaeans can no longer be denied. With the aid of [Root.GetTitledName], a group of fanatics, peasants, and madmen have now banded together to create their own army, to smite heathens and infidels and to protect the righteous. They call themselves the Army of Light, and their holy mission is to fight for the cause of good -- in the eyes of the Manichaeans -- and drive darkness out of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_229;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_231;My [Root.GetLordLady], this extremely generous donation will not be forgotten. You have my friendship, as well as that of the Manichean Church. Rest assured that you will be rewarded in the afterlife, if not on Earth!\nYours in faith,\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_233;My [Root.GetLordLady], this antagonism is completely unwarranted! The Army of Light serves [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], but, one has to wonder, do you?\n\nWith anger and sadness,\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_234;Religious leaders from the province of Baghdad are complaining about the prevelance of Manichaean worshippers. 'It is horrible that you can not walk down a street in Baghdad without tripping over half a dozen Manicheans. Why should we let these infidels continue to live while they tempt others away from the true faith?' They are asking that something be done, lest this become an even greater problem in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_234;We shall crush the Archegos and his followers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_234;No, I will not attack the innocent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_235;Manichaeans Slaughtered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_235;The province of Baghdad was once the center of the Manichaean faith, home to [manichean_leader.GetTitledName] who is their leader. After complaints by [Root.Religion.GetName] worshippers, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has begun a slaughter of all Manichaeans in the region -- beginning with [manichean_leader.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and so ravaging the population that the scholar Ibn al-Nadim reports only finding five remaining in the entire city after the pogrom was finished. The Manicheaean position of Archegos now lies empty, and looks to remain so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_235;An outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_235;So must it be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_236;After the battle is over, your soldiers hail the victory as a great triumph of the Army of Light over your foes, in service to the Army of Darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_236;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] watches over us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_237;After the battle is over, your soldiers curse the defeat as a great triumph of the Army of Darkness over the Army of Light, and shiver in their sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_237;It is the work of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_238;You have begun preparations for the Bema Feast, to celebrate the life and death of the Prophet Mani. You send out messengers with invitations to your vassals, expecting all to come and honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_238;This year it will be very special!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_239;Dear vassal,\nI hereby invite you to attend the celebration of the Bema Feast at [From.Capital.GetName].\n\nYour Liege,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_239;Of course I will go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_239;No, I will not attend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_240;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nAlas, I will not be able to attend the Bema Feast. I will offer thanks to Mani in a much more humble affair at [From.Capital.GetName], but I do appreciate your invitation.\n\nWith sincerity,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_240;The nerve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_241;Guests have arrived from villages throughout the realm, to celebrate the Bema Feast in [Root.Capital.GetName]. The festivities are almost ready to begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_242;Guests have arrived from villages throughout [Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName], to celebrate the Bema Feast in [Liege.Capital.GetName]. [Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] greets you at the entrance to [Liege.GetHerHis] estate, and it seems the festivities are almost ready to begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_243;The Bema Feast is over for now. Another celebration of Light to drive back the Darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_246;It is customary to fast in religious reflection before the start of the Bema Feast. Will you take part in this tradition?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_246;I will fast for a week;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_246;I will fast for the next three days;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GoPagan_246;Go without food? Perish the thought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_247;The Singing of Hymns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_247;The Bema Feast starts with the singing of various hymns that celebrate the return of spring, the life and death of the Prophet Mani, and the battles the Forces of Light have won over the Armies of Darkness. All those gathered raise their voices to the gods, a chorus of faith and beauty that touches the soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_247;This is my favorite part;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_250;The Feast of the Elect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_250;Only the Elect -- those who are devoted to the Manichaean faith -- are invited to take part in a ritual meal, which both symbolizes the life of Mani and the theology of the Manicheans. To take part is a great honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_250;Honor and Glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_251;The Presentation of the Arzhang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_251;The Arzhang, or Picture Book, is a work painted by Mani himself, which depicts the Manichean theology in simple terms, so that even the uneducated can read and understand the faith. The book rests on the bema until the feast is over, after which a priest recites sermons from it and absolves the sins of those attending.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_251;Praise be to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_257;The Persian Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_257;It is said that the Abbasids would never have been able to seize the caliphate without the aid of the great Persian general, Abu Muslim, who in the end was rewarded for his service with death -- executed on the order of Caliph Al-Mansur. Resentment for this perceived betrayal has long simmered as resentment among the Persian people, resentment which has now broken out in open rebellion. A peasant leader by the name of Babak, aided by his capable wife Banu, an effective general and archer in her own right, has risen up to free his nation from the unjust rule of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]...and has already attracted a massive following, enough to present a real threat to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_257;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_257;It's about time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_258;The Mazdaki Priesthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_258;Although the Prophet Mazdak always railed against the corruption of the Zoroastrian Priesthood, and his followers have never had an official structure to speak of, now that the faith has risen to such prominence under [Root.GetTitledName] it seems the time has come to give it to them. With [new_mazdaki_leader.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] chosen as the new [new_mazdaki_leader.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of the [new_mazdaki_leader.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], the Mazdaki faith has entered a new era, with a priesthood rivalling that of the Zoroastrians from which they once stemmed...and have, perhaps, now exceeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_258;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_259;The Mazdaki teach there are four Powers that bring Light into the World: Discernment, Understanding, Preservation, and Joy. Any adult member of the faith may embrace one of these Powers. in an attempt to achieve eventual perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_259;I choose the Power of Discernment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_259;I choose the Power of Understanding;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GoPagan_259;I choose the Power of Preservation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_GoPagan_259;I choose the Power of Joy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_260;You have begun preparations for the Tawûsgeran festival, also known as the 'Circulation of the Peacock'. You send out messengers with invitations to your Yazidi vassals, expecting all to come and honor Melek Taus, greatest among the seven angels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_260;I've been looking forward to this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_261;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\n\nThe time has come once again for us all to celebrate the Tawûsgeran, a time to honor Melek Taus - He who is most holy amongst the seven angels. The festival will take place in [From.Capital.GetName], and you are hereby formally invited to attend.\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_263;The Tawûsgeran festival is well under way when you finally arrive in [FromFrom.Capital.GetName]. Priests walk throughout the crowds, giving out vials of holy water to the faithful. You can hear the holy rites to the Seven being chanted at shrines everywhere you walk, though the name of Melek Taus is most prominent amongst them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_263;An excellent time, to be sure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_264;Peasants are streaming into [Root.Capital.GetName] from all over [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] for the beginning of the Tawûsgeran festival, and already your vassals are arriving. The chanting of rites to Melek Taus can be heard from the many shrines at your window, and soon the true celebrations will begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_265;The Circulation of the Peacock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_265;The Circulation of the Peacock is about to start! In accordance with tradition, priests and pious men carry the senjaq, statues of the Seven Archangels, in circles around the city as they distribute blessings. To carry one of the statues is an honor reserved for only those of great wisdom and piety, as well as an event requiring considerable strength and willpower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_265;I wish to carry one of the statues!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_265;I am content to watch the proceedings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_266;As you carry the heavy senjaq around, you discover that it is rather heavier than you expected. The unaccustomed weight causes you to stumble, and the idol slips out of your hands and crashes down to the ground and is damaged. Everyone stares in horror as you quickly pick it back up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_266;Only a few people saw that...right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_267;As you carry the heavy senjaq around, the weight and the heat begin to take their toll upon you. As if in a dream, you begin to hear the voices of the Seven Archangels talking, telling you secrets and mysteries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_267;They have visited me! I am blessed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_268;With each step of the Circulation, more and more of the truth of your faith is reveled to you. Of course this is the proper path. How could any man doubt such a truth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_268;For the glory of Menek Taus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_269;Perhaps it is the power of faith that fills you, but what once seemed so heavy at the beginning now feels as light as feather. Why, you could carry this senjaq around all day if the priests would let you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_269;Strength comes from faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_270;Veneration of the Senjaq;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_270;After the senjaq have been paraded around the city, the populace of the city comes forward to present their sacrifices and tributes. You visit each senjaq in turn, praying for the wisdom of the Seven Archangels, venerating them with holy incense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_270;For Wisdom and Honor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_271;Gifts From the Pious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_271;The final stage of the Tawûsgeran festival is the collection of alms from the pious. Every man and woman is expected to give, a contribution to the greater faith and in support of those in need. While most give only a few coins, those who are able are expected to give much more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_271;I am a pious [Root.GetManWoman];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_271;I will give what I must, no more;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GoPagan_271;Ignore this nonsense;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_272;The final ceremony is a grand sermon of thanksgiving to God and his servants. It was a rousing sermon as always, and the crowd begins the feast with great abandon. Another glorious celebration of the Seven Archangels has been completed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_272;Praise the Seven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_273;The Tawûsgeran is over for now, and already the many decorations are being taken down. Melek Taus has been properly honored, and the realm is looking forward to a bright future under His wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_273;Until next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_277;Sadly, the death of [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] means the Circulation of the Peacock must be canceled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_GoPagan_278;A glorious day for us all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_279;The pilgrimage to Lalish, a site just outside of the bustling city of Mosul, is one of the most important journeys a Yazidi can undertake. There one attends the Feast of the Assembly, and returns filled with the spirit and strength of the Seven Archangels...or so the story goes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_280;The day has come. Your belongings are packed, arrangements have been made for matters in [Root.Capital.GetName] to be attended to while you are away, and your departure has been kept quiet to prevent the unsavory from taking advantage of your solitary journey.

EVTDESC_GoPagan_281;You arrive in the bustling city of holy Mosul, and it is not long before you make your way to Lalish, a mountain valley village not far to the north. This sleepy place is where the Yazidi faith truly began, and as the Feast of the Assembly unfolds, prayers offered to the Seven Archangels up in the heavens, you marvel at the conical roofs of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir's tomb. The rest of your stay will be spent in Mosul, but you cannot help but feel overcome at having taken a path so many have walked before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_281;Now, what to do next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_285;The Yazidi Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_285;There are many who claim the Yazidi to be devil-worshippers, due to their veneration of the Peacock Angel they call Melek Taus or Shaytan. This has led the Yazidi to be considered Muslim heretics for countless generations, even though their religion incorporates syncretic elements of not only the Muslim faith but also Gnosticism and Zoroastrianism. Now, with [Root.GetTitledName] having risen to such power, [Root.GetSheHe] has declared the Yazidi to be their own faith and no heresy -- and [Root.GetSheHe] has the prestige to be listened to. In the end, it may change nothing save to the Yazidi themselves, but even so it is a sign as to just how far they have come since the ancient days of worshipping at hidden temples in the Kurdish foothills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_116;I have learned that [From.GetTitledName] has laid claim to one of my titles on the grounds of ancestral inheritance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_116;[From.GetSheHeCap] better not try anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_120;I have ruled long enough, and my health is no longer what it once was. Perhaps the time has come to pass my titles onto my heir?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_120;Yes, it is time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_120;No, not just yet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_121;[From.GetTitledName] has decided to voluntarily abdicate [From.GetHerHis] rule, citing poor health and other concerns. [From.GetHerHisCap] titles have been passed onto me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_121;[From.GetSheHeCap] will surely be missed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_126;Even though you have been trying to conceive a child with your husband, it simply hasn't happened... and you are beginning to suspect you might be barren. Some of the maids have whispered that there are things which can be done to remedy this, although they are not entirely without risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_126;I don't care about the risk! I want a child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_126;I will put my faith in [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_126;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] will get no child from me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_127;For some time now, your councilors have made their suspicions known that [barren_wife.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is, in fact, barren. You've denied it, certain that the two of you would have a child before long... but perhaps they are right? Worse, you believe she knows the truth and has said nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_127;How could this have happened?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_130;The [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] is not a realm where all power is rooted in the [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], and thus it does not seem right that [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] should hold so many crowns. Perhaps the [Root.Capital.Kingdom.GetFullName] needs a new ruler?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_130;Demand [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] grant [Root.Capital.Kingdom.GetName] to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_130;[Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] has enough problems, I'm certain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_131;The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] is not a realm where all power resides in the hands of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], and the consensus appears to be that I hold too many titles myself. Thus it is no surprise that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has demanded the crown of [From.Capital.Kingdom.GetName] be granted to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_131;Give [From.GetHerHim] the crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_131;I will give it to one of my children instead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_131;The crown will go to someone in line for the title;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_131;I will give it to someone with a claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_131;How dare [From.GetSheHe] even ask! The crown is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_132;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nKnow that I consider you even asking me to surrender the crown of [Root.Capital.Kingdom.GetName] to be impertinent. My titles are mine to keep, and I will kindly ask you to remember your place.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_132;Impertinent? How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_133;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nWhile your argument regarding the need for the crown of [Root.Capital.Kingdom.GetName] to not rest in my hands seems valid, know that I have decided to give it to another. I trust you will show them the same loyalty and consideration you have always shown me.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_133;The crown should have been mine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_135;[Root.Liege.GetTitledName] has declared an Antipope, [Root.RelHead.GetTitledName], in opposition to the true Pope. As a good [Root.Religion.GetName], I should consider whether I support [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] in [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] actions, or whether I believe [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] has done nothing more than undermine the authority of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_135;I support [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_135;I support the true Pope;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_135;I don't care who the Pope is, to be perfectly frank;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_140;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] has decided to set you aside. As of this moment, by the laws of the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith, you are no longer married.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_140;That bitch! How dare she!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_140;That bastard! How dare he!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_141;News has reached you that [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] has decided to set aside your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. According to the laws of the [FromFromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith, the two are no longer married.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_142;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], has decided to establish a cadet branch of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty. From now on, he and all his descendants will be known as the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_143;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], has decided to establish a cadet branch of the [old_dynasty_head.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty. From now on, he and all his descendants will be known as the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_144;It is no longer enough for me to be a member of the [old_dynasty_head.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty. That legacy belongs to my elder brother, while I was expected for lesser things. Now that I am the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], it is time to establish a legacy in my own name. From now on, my descendants and I will be known as the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_144;My accomplishments will be my own;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_145;The [old_dynasty_head.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], the [old_dynasty_head.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty has become decadent, and Allah would not look favorably upon it. From now on, my descendants and I will be known as the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty, and we shall establish a new chapter in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_146;The time has come to break away from my relatives in the [old_dynasty_head.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty. As the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], I hereby declare that my descendants shall be part of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_150_transit;Finally, an opportunity has arisen to abduct [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] when [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] takes a planned journey from [Root.PlotTarget.Location.GetName] to a nearby town. Shall I tell my co-conspirators to begin their preparations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_150_bed;Finally, an opportunity to abduct [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] has arisen. One of the [Root.PlotTarget.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s personal guard has proven amenable to bribery, allowing for the opportunity to take [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] while [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] sleeps. Shall I tell my co-conspirators to begin their preparations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_150_hunting;Finally, an opportunity has arisen to abduct [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] when [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] goes on a planned hunting trip over a week from now. The perfect chance to catch [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] away from court! Shall I tell my co-conspirators to begin their preparations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_150_carouse;Finally, an opportunity to abduct [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] has arisen. The [Root.PlotTarget.GetManWoman]'s amourous nature has betrayed [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim]--a planned trip to a brothel in [Root.PlotTarget.Location.GetName] will prove the perfect chance, if we move quickly. Shall I tell my co-conspirators to begin their preparations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_150;We must proceed with the plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_150;Not yet, this is too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_151;At last, after having watched our target here in [Root.Location.GetName] for so long, an opportunity for abduction has arisen. I must tell the others at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_151;With luck, this will be over soon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_152;My dear [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nIt seems the opportunity to abduct [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is finally upon us. I ask that you stand ready to make your move. If we fail this chance, it will not come again quickly.\n\nMy thanks,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_155;My co-conspirators send word that they have prepared everything we need to discredit [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]. Documents of [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] corruption have been prepared, and courtiers have been bribed to whisper to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] of [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis]'s incompetence. With [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] reputation in tatters, [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] will find it impossible to hold on to [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] position on the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_155;That position will be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_156;I have found myself the target of a vicious campaign of slander at court. Rumors of incompetence and corruption have undermined the authority of my position, and it seems that even [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] have come to believe them as I have been removed from my position at the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_156;I am ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_157;The attempt to discredit [From.GetTitledFirstName] was a success! [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] has dismissed [From.GetHerHim] from the council and [From.GetHerHis] position is now vacant and ready for me to occupy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_157;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_158;Lately it seems that I have heard nothing but bad of [From.GetTitledFirstName], from whispers of incompetence at court to documents proving [From.GetHerHis] corruption slipped under my bedroom door at night. I refused to believe it at first, but in the end I could not deny the weight of the evidence and was forced to remove [From.GetTitledFirstName] from [From.GetHerHis] position at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_158;It had to be done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_159;I have found myself the target of a vicious campaign of slander at court. Whispers of incompetence and accusations of corruption have been directed at me, but fortunately [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have refused to give them credence and ordered an investigation into the source of the rumors. Although the investigation turned up nothing, my position at court is secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_159;Who could have instigated such an underhanded scheme?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_160;Despite the rumors and accusations directed at [From.GetTitledFirstName], [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] refused to dismiss [From.GetHerHim] from the council and has ordered an investigation into the source of the rumors. Fortunately, the investigation turned up no evidence of my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_160;It could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_161;Lately it seems that I have heard nothing but bad of [From.GetTitledFirstName], from whispers of incompetence at court to documents proving [From.GetHerHis] corruption slipped under my bedroom door at night. I refused to believe the accusations, and ordered an investigation into the source of the rumors. A thorough questioning of the court turned up nothing, but has at least put a stop to the slanderous accusations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_162;I have found myself the target of a vicious campaign of slander at court. Whispers of incompetence and accusations of corruption have been directed at me, but fortunately [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have refused to give them credence and ordered an investigation into their source which revealed the involvement [From.GetTitledName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_162;[From.GetTitledFirstName] will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_163;Despite the rumors and accusations directed at [From.GetTitledFirstName], [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] refused to dismiss [From.GetHerHim] from the council. Even worse, [Root.Liege.GetFirstName] ordered an investigation into the source of the rumors, which turned up evidence of my involvement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_163;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] is not pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_164;Lately it seems that I have heard nothing but bad of [From.GetTitledFirstName], from whispers of incompetence at court to documents proving [From.GetHerHis] corruption slipped under my bedroom door at night. I refused to believe the accusations and ordered an investigation of their source which revealed the involvement of [FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_164;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_170;The tithes and taxes for [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] are on their way to [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] castle and my co-conspirators have bribed the guards not to notice if a chest or two should go 'missing'. Everything is ready for the robbery to proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_170;We'll all be rich!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_171;The taxes and tithes due to me arrived at the castle today and were placed in the treasury. As I was inspecting the chests full of gold, it struck me that there seemed to be fewer of them than what had arrived earlier. A quick check of the treasurer's accounts revealed my worst fears...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_171;I have been robbed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_172;As the taxes were being hauled into the treasury, several large chests full of gold made their way onto the back of a wagon which left the castle unnoticed. The gold is now safely locked away in my treasury and my co-conspirators have all received their share.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_172;Everything went as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_173;I have received my share of the money embezzled by [From.GetTitledFirstName] from [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_174;The taxes and tithes due to me arrived at the castle today. As I was watching the money being carried into the treasury, I noticed some shadowy figures trying to make off with several chests full of gold. I had my guards seize them, and under questioning they revealed themselves to be in the employ of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. What shall be done with my thieving vassal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_174;Throw [From.GetTitledFirstName] in irons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_174;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_174;Forgive [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_175;As the taxes were being hauled into the treasury, my men tried to make off with several chests of gold but were spotted by [From.GetTitledFirstName], who had come out to inspect the process [From.GetHerHim]self. Under questioning they revealed to myself to be in my employ, and now [From.GetTitledFirstName] knows that I attempted to rob [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_175;Retribution is sure to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_180;My co-conspirators have fabricated evidence that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is planning a revolt against [Root.PlotTarget.Liege.GetHerHis] liege. The evidence will discreetly find its way into the hands of [Root.PlotTarget.Liege.GetTitledFirstName], who cannot fail to act on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_180;I will see [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] disgraced!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_181;Word has reached me that [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] has publicly accused me of treason based on evidence found in some documents that were slipped under [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] bedroom door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_181;This must be a scheme to see me arrested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_182;[From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] was completely fooled by the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. It can only be a matter of time before [From.GetSheHe] is arrested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_183;As I rose from bed, I found a small bundle of documents that had been slipped beneath my bedroom door. The documents contained evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s plans to depose me and seize the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_183;I must have [From.GetHerHim] arrested!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_184;As I rose from bed, I found a small bundle of documents that had been slipped beneath my bedroom door. The documents contained evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s plans to depose me and seize the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_184;I wonder who sent it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_185;[From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. Although the scheme has failed, at least there is no evidence of my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_186;As I rose from bed, I found a small bundle of documents that had been slipped beneath my bedroom door. The documents contained evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s plans to depose me and seize the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_186;Nothing but lies and slander;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_187;[From.GetTitledFirstName] tried to have me arrested for treason by slipping fabricated 'evidence' under [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s bedroom door, but fortunately [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] caught [From.GetHerHis] agent in the act and now it is [From.GetTitledFirstName] that stands accused of treason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_187;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_188;My agent was caught in the act of slipping the fabricated evidence under [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s bedroom door. Even worse, my involvement was revealed during questioning and now I am the one that stands accused of treason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_188;This is bad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_189;As I was getting ready to sleep, I heard a scuffle from outside my bedroom door. Rushing outside, I found that my guards had seized a cloaked man as he was attempting to slip some documents into the room. Under questioning, he revealed that he was working for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] and that the documents were fabricated evidence intended to turn me against my vassal [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_189;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is the true traitor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_195;My co-conspirators have fabricated evidence of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]'s blasphemous conduct and sheltering of heretics. The letter will be sent to [Root.PlotTarget.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] who will be forced to excommunicate [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_195;God will be my judge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_196;Word has reached me that [Root.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] has had me excommunicated based on fabricated 'evidence' of blasphemy and heresy sent to [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] in an anonymous letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_196;God preserve me from these lies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_197;[From.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] was completely fooled by the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s heresy. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been excommunicated and interdict has been placed on [From.GetHerHis] lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_197;It was the will of God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_198;Word has reached me that [Root.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] has received fabricated 'evidence' of blasphemy and heresy sent to [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] in an anonymous letter. Fortunately, [Root.RelHead.GetSheHe] dismissed it as the slanderous lie it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_198;God looks after the faithful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_199;[From.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s heresy. Although the scheme has failed, at least there is no evidence of my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_200;Word has reached me that [Root.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] has received fabricated 'evidence' of blasphemy and heresy sent to [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] in an anonymous letter. However, [Root.RelHead.GetSheHe] not only refused to believe it, but had the messenger questioned until he revealed the sender of the letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_200;It was sent by [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_201;[From.RelHead.GetTitledFirstName] refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s heresy. What's worse, [From.RelHead.GetSheHe] had the messenger questioned and found out that I sent it! I have been censured for my 'unseemly scheming' and [From.GetTitledFirstName] knows that I tried to have [From.GetHerHim] excommunicated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_201;This will not help my reputation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_205;My co-conspirators have fabricated evidence that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is planning a revolt against me. I will circulate the evidence among my vassals so that they will support my actions against the 'traitor'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_206;Word has reached me that documents indicting me in a plan to revolt against [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have been circulating through the realm. Though the evidence is obviously a forgery, it seems almost everyone in the realm has been fooled by it, and I fear I am about to be arrested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_206;Who could have done such a thing?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_207;My vassals were completely fooled by the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. I am now free to act against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_208;Word has reached me that documents indicting me in a plan to revolt against [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have been circulating through the realm. Fortunately most of the lords of the realm have dismissed it as the forgery it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_208;I wonder who was behind it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_209;My vassals refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. Although the scheme has failed, at least there is no evidence of my involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_210;Word has reached me that documents indicting me in a plan to revolt against [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] have been circulating through the realm. One of the forger's agents was caught while handing out the forgeries on my lands, and questioning revealed him to be working for [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_211;My vassals refused to believe the fabricated evidence of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason. What's worse, one of my agents was caught and questioned while circulating the forgeries, and my involvement has been revealed to all my vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_211;My reputation is ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_215;Success! [kidnap_victim.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has been delivered in a sack to an abandoned keep near [kidnap_victim.Location.GetName]. There [kidnap_victim.GetSheHe] is at my mercy, and no-one can hear [kidnap_victim.GetHerHis] screams. All that remains is to decide what to do with [kidnap_victim.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_215;[kidnap_victim.GetSheHeCap] will give me the [demanded_title.GetFullName], or else!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_215;[kidnap_victim.GetSheHeCap] will name [demanded_vassal.GetTitledName] my vassal, or else!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_215;Bring [kidnap_victim.GetHerHim] to my dungeon--I will decide later;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_215;Now [kidnap_victim.GetSheHe] dies--quietly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_216;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! You struggle, but it is no use--your captors are strong, and it is not long before you find yourself in the dungeons of [From.GetTitledName]. There, [From.GetSheHe] informs you, you shall remain until [From.GetSheHe] decides otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_216;[From.GetSheHeCap] will pay for this outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_217;[From.GetTitledName] recently went missing, and after a frantic search by [From.GetHerHis] guards, it seemed as if [From.GetSheHe] had simply vanished into thin air! Not so, apparently. It turns out [From.GetSheHe] was forcibly abducted by agents of [FromFrom.GetTitledName], who intends to keep [From.GetHerHim] in [FromFrom.GetHerHis] dungeons until [FromFrom.GetSheHe] decides otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_218;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! You struggle, but it is no use--your captors are strong, and it is not long before you find yourself in a dungeon. There, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] reveals [From.GetHerHim]self as your captor, and states you have only to hand over the [demanded_title.GetFullName] to achieve your freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_218;Take it! Just let me go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_218;[From.GetSheHeCap] will get nothing from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_219;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] clearly didn't like it, but then again you left [From.GetHerHim] little choice. The [demanded_title.GetFullName] is yours. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has not told anyone exactly how you got the title, of course, but there are whispers. Even so, what does it matter now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_220;While [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] earlier seemed to have no intention of granting the [demanded_title.GetFullName] to anyone, suddenly [From.GetSheHe] changed [From.GetHerHis] mind and granted it to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]. Could this have something to do with [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s recent unexplained absence from [From.Location.GetName]? No-one appears to know for certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_221;'You will get nothing from me! Do your worst!' [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] spits in your face, refusing to give into your demands...though you can clearly see the fear in [From.GetHerHis] face. The [From.GetManWoman] is brave, evidently. So now what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_221;Now [From.GetSheHe] rots in my dungeon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_221;Now [From.GetSheHe] dies--quietly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_221;I'm not going to kill [From.GetHerHim]! Just...let [From.GetHerHim] go;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_222;'Then you will remain a guest in my dungeon until I decide just what to do with you,' [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] says with a shrug. With that, [From.GetSheHe] leaves, and you are left in the dark and the cold to wonder whether that was the wisest choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_223;After recently vanishing without a trace from [FromFrom.GetHerHis] court, [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s lifeless corpse was discovered soon afterwards on the bank of a nearby river. People throughout [Root.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are shocked by the scandal, which gets worse when it is revealed that [From.GetTitledName] was behind the deed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_224;While [From.GetSheHe] appears torn, it turns out that [From.GetSheHe] cannot, in fact, order your death. [From.GetSheHe] turns and walks out, swearing, and some time later you are discovered by a passing peasant and released. You are unharmed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_224;A relief, but still...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_225;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! You struggle, but it is no use--your captors are strong, and it is not long before you find yourself in a dungeon. There, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] reveals [From.GetHerHim]self as your captor, and states you have only to make [demanded_vassal.GetTitledName] [From.GetHerHis] vassal to achieve your freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_225;Take the vassal, just let me go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_226;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nI cannot tell you the reasons behind my decision. Simply trust that they exist. With that in mind, I have elected to transfer your vassalage to [FromFrom.GetTitledName], effective immediately. May [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] have mercy upon us all.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_227;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] clearly didn't like it, but then again you left [From.GetHerHim] little choice. [demanded_vassal.GetTitledName] is now your vassal. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has not told anyone exactly how this arrangement came to be, of course, but there are whispers. Even so, what does it matter now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_228;While [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] earlier seemed to have no intention of surrendering any of [From.GetHerHis] vassals to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], suddenly [From.GetSheHe] changed [From.GetHerHis] mind and granted [FromFrom.GetHerHim] lordship over [demanded_vassal.GetTitledName]. Could this have something to do with [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s recent unexplained absence from [From.Location.GetName]? No-one appears to know for certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_229;Alas, [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] surprised the kidnappers with the ferocity of [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] struggle, and they were forced to flee when [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] guards came running. While an investigation is underway, currently no-one is aware that you were behind the assault.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_230;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! Outraged, you struggle--well enough that guards come running, and your kidnappers are forced to flee. Sadly, they escaped...meaning you have no idea who was behind this assault on your person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_230;Surely SOMEONE must know the truth?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_231;Disaster! [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] surprised the kidnappers with the ferocity of [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] struggle, and while they fled when guards came running, they were quickly caught. Even worse, the men gave up your name as their employer! You've denied it, naturally, but [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] clearly does not believe you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_232;You are sleeping quite soundly in your bed when you are suddenly rudely awoken by a bag being thrust over your head! Outraged, you struggle--well enough that guards come running, and your kidnappers are forced to flee. They are quickly caught, and upon questioning give up [From.GetTitledName] as their employer. [From.GetSheHeCap] tried to have you abducted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_235;Tonight may be the night. I spotted [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] going up to [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] rooms alone after an eve of drinking. I doubt [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is in a condition to resist my charms, if I choose to follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_235;It's now or never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_235;I lack the courage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_236;I've observed the comings and going of the target of a particularly romantic plot, and think I can faciliate a private meeting for the two of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_236;Send a message to the plotter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_237;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has contacted me, saying [From.GetSheHe] believes that [From.GetSheHe] can help me meet [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] privately, and in a condition where [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] will almost certainly be unable to resist my charms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_238;The plan was successful. I crept into [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName]'s bed, and before [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] could react, I showed [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] what a night with a real [Root.GetManWoman] looks like. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] did not ask me to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_239;It happened rather suddenly. One moment I was alone in my bed, and then the next [From.GetTitledFirstName] was there with me. I was about to cry for the guards, but the things [From.GetSheHe] he did... I did not want them to stop, and I have not wanted to since the night it happened. I cannot stop thinking about [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_239;How did that happen? Was I drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_240;My attempts at seduction have failed! [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] not only threw me out of his room, but threatened to have the guards throw me out of the castle as well. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] is not pleased with me, and [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is not the only one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_241;It happened so quickly. One minute I was alone in my bed, and the next I woke to discover [From.GetTitledFirstName] attempting to seduce me. I threw [From.GetHerHim] out in a rage, and threatened to call the guards if [From.GetSheHe] tried anything so outrageous again. The nerve of the [From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_241;Denied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_250;Your shameful adherence to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is an affront to myself and my supporters, and it must come to an end. I hereby demand that you convert to the [From.Religion.GetName], faithfully and in the sight of [From.Religion.GetHighGodName], or we will resort to force of arms to see you dethroned.\n\nSIgned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_250;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] forgive me, I have no choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_250;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_251;Rather than risking civil war tearing the realm apart, I have decided to give in to your demand and convert to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. But this treacherous act of blackmail will not be forgotten...\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_252;Rather than letting civil war tear the realm apart, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has agreed to convert to the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith. Your valuable support in this conflict will not be forgotten, not by myself and not by [FromFrom.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n\nSincerely,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_253;Under pressure from [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] supporters, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to convert to the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_254;Your shameful attempt at blackmail has not succeeded. No matter how many corrupted souls you have enticed to help carry out your plan, I will not give in without a fight. I'd rather die in the name of the true [From.Religion.GetName] faith and defending what is rightfully mine!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_255;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nI have gathered enough supporters to finally take a stand against [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. Either [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] convert to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, or we will rise up against [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] and install a properly [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] in [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] stead. I ask that you either join us now, or stand aside should the matter come to a civil war.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_262A;Unsettling news—while you currently have no proof of it, you are all but certain that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is conspiring with unknown parties to wrest the regency from your grasp. Unless you act soon, [From.GetSheHe] may very well soon succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_262B;Unsettling news—while you currently have no proof of it, you are all but certain that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is conspiring with unknown parties to wrest the regency from [Root.Liege.Regent.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. just as you are. If you do not act to stop [From.GetHerHim] now, [From.GetSheHe] may very well beat you to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_262;I will stop [From.GetHerHim], if I can;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_262;I must wait for proof, and not make things worse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_263A;Your scheming to replace [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] as [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent apparently came to [From.GetHerHis] notice, as suddenly you find yourself without access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] at all. Worse, any efforts to bring the matter before the court have evaporated. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has outmaneuvered you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_263B;Your scheming to replace [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] as [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent apparently came to the notice of [From.GetTitledName], as [From.GetSheHe] has somehow not only blocked your access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] but also to the court. You have been outmaneuvered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_264;You acted quickly to block [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], and to ensure [FromFrom.GetSheHe] would have no chance to bring the matter before the court...and you were successful. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] has been outmaneuvered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_265;While you tried to block [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [FromFrom.GetSheHe] somehow managed to get around your efforts even so. If [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is truly scheming against you, [FromFrom.GetHerHis] efforts continue as before, unhindered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_266;At first it seems like [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has become aware of your scheme to take the regency, but [From.GetHerHis] bungling has only infuriated some of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s courtiers and made it more likely that your efforts will come to fruition far sooner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_267;While you tried to block [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s access to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [FromFrom.GetSheHe] somehow managed to get around your efforts even so. Worse, you managed to infuriate some of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s courtiers and made [FromFrom.GetHerHis] scheming far easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_268;You're uncertain what's going on in the court, exactly, but you know something is. [FromFrom.GetTitledName] is no longer allowed to see you, and you don't know why...only that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] says it's for the best. Maybe it is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_269;Something is amiss in your court, but you don't understand exactly what. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] came to visit you recently and said that your regent, [From.GetTitledName], is bungling things badly. With any luck, that will soon change and then [FromFrom.GetSheHe] will be around far more. Wouldn't that be grand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_270A;As both [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent and heir, it has not been a difficult matter to get agreement on the idea that perhaps it is time I take over rule of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth. It is not as if [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] is going to get better, after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_270B;With [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] unable to rule, it has fallen to you to ensure things in [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] continue to run smoothly. As such close family to [Root.Liege.GetHerHim], there are many who are willing to see [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] regent become the ruler in truth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_270C;As [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent, it has not been overly difficult to arrange a conspiracy to see you take over rule of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth. The time for the attempt to be made appears to now be at hand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_270;Let us make the attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_270;No, I should abandon this now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_271;While you have slowly assumed more and more of the duties of rulership in [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName], it seems you were unable to convince [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s councillors and lords to take that final step. They have not restricted your powers, but it's clear they'll resist any attempts for you to take control...for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_272;It seems your efforts to take the rule of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] into your own hands were noticed too soon. Several of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s vassals took serious exception to the idea and raised a great furor, and now your attempt is being called both treachery and usurpation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_273;You're not quite sure what all the fuss is, but a bunch of soldiers came in and arrested [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. They said [From.GetSheHe] was trying to take away your throne! What an odd thing to do. It's so large! Where would [From.GetSheHe] put it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_273;I suppose they'll find me another regent, now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_274;Dangerous business is afoot in [Root.Liege.Capital.GetName]: [From.GetTitledName] attempted to usurp [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s titles, and as [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] regent [From.GetSheHe] very well almost got away with it! [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has been arrested, and another regent shall be found for [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] shortly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_275;Success! Your duties as regent have been expanded to the point where the difference between you and [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is a mere formality...a formality which has now been dispensed with entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_276A;Perhaps it was time. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] came to tell you that [From.GetSheHe] would be taking over rule of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] formally, and thus would no longer be my regent. [From.GetSheHeCap] was my heir, so...that's good, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_276B;Dear [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] came to tell you that [From.GetSheHe] would be taking over rule of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] formally, and thus would no longer be my regent. [From.GetSheHeCap] said it was for my own good, and for the good of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]...and you're hardly in a position to disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_276C;Everyone's making such a fuss. You can barely understand it, but it seems [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] rules in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] now, and not you. But that doesn't seem right, does it? [From.GetSheHeCap]'s your regent, not the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]! Yet everyone keeps saying it, so it must be true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_276;I hope being [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] makes [From.GetHerHim] happy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_277A;With [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] no longer able to rule, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has stepped up from being simply [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] regent and heir to ruling [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth. Many consider the move for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_277B;With [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] no longer able to rule, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has slowly transformed from being simply [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] regent to ruling [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth. Despite [From.GetHerHis] close relation to [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], some are calling this an usurpation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_277C;Dangerous business is afoot in [Root.Liege.Capital.GetName]: [From.GetTitledName] has slowly expanded [From.GetHerHis] duties as [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s regent until the distinction between them was a mere formality...and now that formality has been dispensed with entirely. [From.GetSheHeCap] has usurped the rule of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_280;After many months of effort, you have found several [Root.Culture.GetName] lords in [Root.Capital.County.GetName] who quietly seethe at the rule of [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]...and with some subtle pushes, they could become much less quiet. Of course, this will also give [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s spymaster the best chance to catch you in the act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_280;Let us proceed with this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_280;It's too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_281;Success! The [Root.Culture.GetName] lords have no idea you were the person behind their 'donations'...nor the incidents which have made their rage against [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] all the greater. Now it simply remains to see if this leads to anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_282;Alas, the [Root.Culture.GetName] lords are either too cowardly to speak openly against [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] or their words fall on too many deaf ears. Nothing has come of your efforts in [Root.Capital.County.GetName], but thankfully no-one is aware of your involvement. We will have to wait for another chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_283;Disaster! One of the [Root.Culture.GetName] lords recognized your agent, and evidently believed that you were trying to trick him. He has been complaining loudly in [Root.Capital.GetName], loudly enough that agents of [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] overheard and have pieced together what really happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_284;My [Root.GetLordLady], we have word from an agent in [From.Capital.County.GetName] that [From.GetTitledName] was attempting to incite rebellion amongst the [From.Culture.GetName] peasants--a rebellion that almost certainly would have been directed against your rule. [From.GetHerHisCap] efforts thankfully failed, and we have proof of [From.GetHerHis] deeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_284;Has [From.GetSheHe] gone mad?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_285;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nIt has recently come to my attention that [From.GetBestName] plots against you, and thus I felt it best if you were to be aware of that fact. I trust you will take whatever steps required to protect yourself.\n\nWith respect,\n[FromFrom.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_285;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] is [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s liege -- [FromFrom.GetSheHe] should do something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_285;This is good to know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_286;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI truly appreciate your assistance in alerting me to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s scheme, though as [FromFrom.GetHerHis] liege, I truly hope you will also take steps to deal with [FromFrom.GetHerHis] criminal behavior.\n\nWith gratitude,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_287;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI truly appreciate your assistance in alerting me to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s scheme. It seems I will have to deal with [FromFrom.GetHerHim], and quickly.\n\nWith gratitude,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_288;Unfortunately, it appears that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] has become aware of your plot against [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim]. You strongly suspect that [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s spymaster learned of the plot and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] then revealed it to [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_293;Some guards have been convinced to be 'pre-occupied' for a while. This could be the perfect opportunity to elope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_293;We will elope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_294;Thanks to the guards being distracted tonight you were easily able to slip out to your lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_294;Finally we are together;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_295;After much anxious waiting you finally see your lover approach the meeting spot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_295;Finally we shall be married;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_296;It would seem [From.GetFirstName] has vanished from your court. There are whispers that [From.GetSheHe] has eloped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_296;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_297;Despite your best attempts your liege was sticking unusually close to you tonight and you could not avoid [Root.Liege.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_297;It's almost like they knew...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_298;After waiting for hours at the meeting spot you begin to realize that something is amiss. A discreet messenger arrives from your lover telling you that she could not safely leave to meet you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_298;We'll just have to try again;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_299;You decided to stay out and about more than usual tonight. A strange air lingers around [From.GetFirstName] and the guards were acting a bit off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_299;Perhaps I am being paranoid...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_303;The sharp decline of my power and territories have not gone unnoticed by other rulers. While I continue to insist on my claims to Imperial dignity, it is clear that my peers no longer take them seriously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_303;But I *am* the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_304;The change in crown authority has forced me to change some of my demesne laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_310;My changes to the crown authority of the Empire have now been fully implemented across the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_325;This was not a just act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_325;Oh well;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_326;I have reclaimed the Byzantine Empire for the Orthodox faith. The title of Augustus is rightfully mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_326;Glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_327;Following a faith completely different from Catholicism, I cannot legitimately claim to be Latin Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_328;Following a faith completely different from Orthodoxy, I cannot legitimately claim to be Byzantine Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_334;The province of [converted_province.GetName] has finally seen the light, with the majority of its inhabitants at last accepting your culture. This should make your realm easier to manage and better unify your people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_336;Those who have gone into hiding have been sent a message to return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_338;Following a faith completely different from Catholicism, I cannot legitimately claim to be Holy Roman Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_341;As I move to re-assume power in [FromFrom.GetBaseName], I am approached by a cabal of local lords insisting I step down in favour of my heir, lest they rebel again and force the issue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_361;One of the startup flags has gone missing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_400;The Crusade was a great success, but to whom shall I grant the lands I have gained?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_400;To my son;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_400;To a capable relative;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_400;To myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_400;To my brother;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_Plus_400;To a valiant retainer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_401;The Crusade was a great success and now I must decide whether to request a fief in the captured lands for one of my relatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_401;Request a fief for my son;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_401;Request a fief for my brother;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_401;Request a fief for a relative;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_401;No, our victory belongs to God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_402;I have distributed fiefs in my new lands among the relatives of the Crusading lords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_412;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] owed tribute to [current_suzerain.GetTitledName], but that arrangement doesn't necessarily apply to you, [From.GetHerHis] heir. Of course, [current_suzerain.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] might not agree with that idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_412;I will pay tribute to [current_suzerain.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_412;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is no-one's tribute;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_413;Shortly following the death of [FromFrom.GetTitledName], an emissary has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] from [FromFrom.GetHerHis] heir, offering to renew the tribute from [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] towards the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. Turn the emissary away, and [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] will be free of our control...and our protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_413;Naturally we will accept their tribute;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_413;[From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is more trouble than it's worth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_414;Your emissary has returned from [From.Capital.GetName], explaining that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] cheerfully accepted [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s continued tribute towards the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_415;Your emissary has returned from [From.Capital.GetName] with dire news: [From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused the offer of tribute, declaring that [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is 'more trouble than it's worth'. You are freed from [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s control, but also its protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_415;Does [From.GetSheHe] mean to attack us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_416;Shortly following the death of [FromFrom.GetTitledName], an emissary has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] from [FromFrom.GetHerHis] heir, declaring that [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] shall no longer be subject to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] nor shall it offer any further tribute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_416;Let [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] go;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_416;Is that so? We'll see about that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_417;The recent death of [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] leaves us with a decision to make: does [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] offer tribute to [From.GetHerHis] heir, [new_suzerain.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], or does it declare itself free of both [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s control and protection?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_417;We will offer tribute to [new_suzerain.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_417;We will be tributes to [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] no longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_418;An emissary has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] from [From.GetTitledName], offering to extend the arrangement of tribute between [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_418;Of course we shall accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_418;No, [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is more trouble than it's worth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_419;An emissary has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] from [From.GetTitledName], declaring that, with the death of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] shall no longer be subject to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] nor shall it offer any further tribute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_425;Little [From.GetFirstName] is the spitting image of [From.GetHerHis] father, [From.Father.GetTitledFirstName]. We are unmarried, of course, but I can hardly deny the child is mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_425;I love [From.GetHerHim], anyway;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_430;Recent events have brought to rise the question: is the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] truly part of the [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]? If not, this is your chance to declare independence from the [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] -- but beware, as [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] will have a claim to come after [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] later, if [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_430;Declare independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_430;No, I remain faithful to [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_431;It seems that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] does not consider [From.GetHerHim]self a part of your realm, and has declared the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]'s independence from [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_431;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_434;You spend an evening with [debater.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] as [debater.GetSheHe] goes on at length about the importance of [debater.Religion.GetName] virtues. It turns into a lively debate, and one [debater.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] seems insistent on winning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_434;Win a debate? Against me? Hah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_434;I'll skillfully steer us onto another topic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_434;[debater.GetSheHeCap] can't win--I cheat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_434;I'll let [debater.GetHerHim] win--this time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_435;We started early, the sun had barely risen above the horizon. There was plenty of prey, the dogs caught many rabbits and I slayed one great boar before he killed my horse and myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_435;I'm a hunter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_435;That lifestyle is not for me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_436;The new bird is almost too perfect. I enjoy every hunt with her, and the cook has trouble finding new recipes for rabbit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_436;I'm a falconer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_437;I'm never happier than when I'm in my study, poring over some newly imported volume. Books are truly God's greatest gift to man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_437;I'm a scholar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_438;I found the strange book collecting dust in a forgotten corner of the castle library. It took me several weeks of intense study before its mystery revealed itself to me. The gibberish parts was encoded and after many hours trying to decipher I managed to break it and construct a key to make it easier for me to read. Its mystery is still not solved...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_438;I'm a mystic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_439;My regular excursions into the dungeon have only served to whet my appetite. I have sent for a skilled torturer who will teach me more about the arts of pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_439;I'm an impaler;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_440;My garden is the apple of my eye, my pride and joy. I distrust my gardener and would spend every hour of the day in my garden if I could.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_440;I'm a gardener;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_441;My modest attempts to write poetry were never meant to be published in any way, but wherever I go, bards and minstrels are reciting or singing my poems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_441;I'm a poet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_442;There is nothing that brings me more joy than the day-to-day task of ruling [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Some may think it lacks glory, but I do it well enough that I've become known for my prowess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_442;I'm an administrator!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_443;This lifestyle of utmost pleasure and joyous life suits me perfectly. This can be nothing but heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_443;I'm a hedonist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_444;The duel was close fought, but in the end I was victorious over my opponent. As I basked in the admiration of my peers, I knew that I had to do this again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_444;I'm a duelist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_445;I have finally become an expert in Islamic jurisprudence! My knowledge of the Qur'an, the Sunnah, Ijma' (Consensus) and Qiyas (Analogy) is what makes me a faqih and I will use that knowledge to be a better [Root.GetTitle] and ruler of my people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_445;I am proud to have become a faqih!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_446;Whenever the engineers are working in [Root.Capital.GetName], I always make an effort to visit them and talk. They have such interesting ideas! Building things has always been a pleasure for me, whether they be physical or far more abstract.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_446;I'm an architect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_447;What goes on behind a battle is far more interesting to me than the actual fighting. Strategies, manoeuvres, even the issues of attrition and supply...these are the things that matter most when it comes to victory, and it applies to far more things than simply the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_447;I'm a strategist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_448;Spending time with other people--that's what gives me energy. Talking with them, knowing the things they want or don't want. I've always had a knack for it, and wherever I go you're bound to find me in the centre of the largest and loudest group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_448;I'm a socializer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_449;I watch everything, and I listen. Other people don't see what I see--the cause and effect of every action, the moves and counter-moves that are required to make something happen. When I take action, it's very likely nobody will even know I did it. That is how plans succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_449;I'm a schemer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_450;Playing a game well means understanding its inner workings. You must know the rules, you must know your opponent's strengths and weaknesses. It is life and politics played out on the chessboard. I play because I win, and I like winning...and, yes, sometimes just for fun. What could be better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_450;I'm a gamer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_451;On a stormy but otherwise peaceful night in [Root.Capital.GetName], a traveling [Root.Religion.GetName] merchant takes refuge in your holding. He seems like an interesting man, and you've nothing else to distract you. How do you spend the evening?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_451;Entertaining him, of course;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_451;Discussing fighting techniques with his guards;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_451;Debating him on matters of history;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_451;Relaxing by myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_452;There is a social event happening this evening in [Root.Capital.GetName], one of the most important [Root.Capital.Religion.GetName] holidays. Everyone of importance will be partaking in the revelry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_452;Of course I will attend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_452;I will watch everyone closely;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_452;This is a good opportunity to meet the merchants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_452;They can do without me for one evening;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_453;On a quiet day in [Location.GetName], you can't help but notice some of your knights sparring. One of them is doing a poor job of it, and the other men are making sport of his failures rather than helping him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_453;Time to show them all a few tricks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_453;I'll intervene, and perhaps raise morale;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_453;They need a lecture on good [Root.Religion.GetName] virtues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_453;I will relax and leave them to it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_454;You overhear some courtiers in [Root.Location.GetName] arguing about the war. The disagreement is clearly about how a ruler could best contribute to victory. When they see you, they immediately go quiet and leave...but afterwards, you decide you have your own answer to their issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_454;By leading the armies into battle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_454;By knowing what happens before the enemy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_454;By keeping the armies fed and paid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_454;By staying alive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_455;Peace reigns in the [Root.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], and for once you are left with nothing to do and no councillors vying for your personal attention. An unusual circumstance, to be sure, but one you can easily solve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_455;There are always matters of ruling to attend to;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_455;I shall call for a hunt in the nearby woods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_455;Time for reading? That almost never happens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_455;I will spend it with my loved ones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_456;You are riding with attendants through [Root.Capital.GetName] when you hear a disturbance ahead. One of your men suggests that you steer around it, as it appears to be some kind of violent dispute in the market between merchants. Hopefully it does not get out of hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_456;I will intervene and resolve their dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_456;I will speak with the men and calm the situation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_456;I will watch to see what's happening, and why;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_456;I have larger issues upon which to focus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_457;Every time I think of my rival, [target_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], I wonder what I would do if [target_rival.GetSheHe] were here before me now, alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_457;Find out what [target_rival.GetSheHe] has planned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_457;Kill [target_rival.GetHerHim], if I could;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_457;Try to resolve our differences;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_457;There's no use indulging such fantasies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_458;I can't stop thinking about my plot to [Root.GetPlot]. So many plans to make, but none of them seem to come to fruition fast enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_458;Then I will make more plans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_458;I will distract myself in the study;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_458;Time to busy myself at court;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_458;I will find a way! I must!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_459;A traveling merchant comes to [Root.Capital.GetName], and it appears he has quite an assortment of rare books to offer. He is naturally quite eager to show them to you, and gauge your interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_459;I will take them all, if I can;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_459;Does he have anything on warfare?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_459;A treatise on governance would be interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_459;I would rather save my coin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_500;The old Anglo-Saxon kingdom of England will now be forfeit…but do not despair! From its ashes a much more powerful and glorious realm will arise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_500;England shall rule victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_501;The old Anglo-Saxon kingdom of England will now be forfeit…but do not despair! From its ashes a much more powerful and glorious realm will arise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_503;The Duchy of Normandy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_503;With the domination of this duchy the people are now more commonly referring to Neustria as Normandy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_504;The Islands and Peninsula south of Rome have fallen to those who oppose Christianity. Whispers have been heard that the pope the is frantically considering funding an expedition to reconquer the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_504;The Fall of Sicily;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_504;What will the pope do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_504;And so they crumble;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_509;Unsurprisingly, the pope has chosen a promising local young Italian mercenary band to take control of Southern Italy away from the Heathens. With official Papal support, this young Mercenary captain hopes to achieve the crown of Sicily, as promised by the pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_509;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_509;The Champions Head Out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_510;The re-conquest of Sicily was an astounding success. The pope has motioned to officially crown the King of Sicily today. Already the pope makes plans for future such events, some have even said they’ve heard rumours of such a thing being called a Crusade. Time can only tell what will happen next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_510;King of Sicily;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_511;In a very surprising and bold move, the Pope has decided to give the Norsemen of the North a chance to prove themselves worthy of the crown of Sicily. Of course they submitted to papal authority prior to being allowed to invade Southern Italy. This should prove to be a very interesting series of events, no matter the outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_512;After having heard the success of the Normans, the pope has decided to give them an offer they can’t refuse. They’ll be allowed to invade southern Italy with full papal support. Should they succeed, they’ll be crowned by the pope himself as Kings of Sicily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_513;Having heard the news of southern Italy’s struggle, some Croatian mercenaries have volunteered to help the pope. Impressed by their determination and self-sacrifice, he has decided to give official papal support to these mercenaries to take back Italy. Should they succeed, the crown of Sicily awaits them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_514;Having heard the news of southern Italy’s struggle, some Serbian mercenaries have volunteered to help the pope. Impressed by their determination and self-sacrifice, he has decided to give official papal support to these mercenaries to take back Italy. Should they succeed, the crown of Sicily awaits them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_515;Often forgotten, there are still resident Greeks in southern Italy. After having affirmed their support of the Pope of Rome they now seek to re-conquer their lost lands from the heathen invaders. Motivation is certainly not lacking for these people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_516;An auspicious day it is indeed, for you will be crowned the King of Sicily by none other than the pope himself. As you approach the pope, you can't help but feel a sense of pride rise within you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_516;The Coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_516;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_517;The pope's plans have failed. His trusted champions have been dispersed, and there's little hope for a Christian reconquering of Sicily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_517;The Sicilian Invasion Fails;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_517;Disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_517;Too bad for the Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_520;A New Culture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_520;A New Culture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_521;A New Culture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_521;The people of Dyrrachion have taken to calling themselves Albanians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_521;I don't care, as long as they pay their taxes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_521;I admire their culture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_522;The Kingdom of Albania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_522;The Kingdom of Albania, once de-jure part of Greece, has formed it's own kingdom under [Root.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_522;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_523;The Kingdom of Albania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_523;The Kingdom of Albania, once de-jure part of Greece, has formed it's own kingdom under [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_523;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_524;Your Grace, the vile Polish have taken the Moravian territories from us and in their naivity they think they could claim the Duchy of Bohemia as well! Of course we could defeat them single-handedly, the problem is that they are a little bit more powerful at the moment and so we should probably resort to some more cunning tactics...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_524;A temporary setback;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_524;They will never take our freedom!! Hopefully;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_535;The Bulgarian state has finally perished by your hands and their 'empire' has collapsed into ruins. The conflict that has lasted decades is over and we can rejoice that our northern borders are safe once more and our control of the Balkans is undisputed. For this achievement you are going to be known for at least another millennium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_535;Call me the Bulgar-Slayer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_536;My lord, nothing less than a miracle has occured. We have repelled the full scale Byzantine invasion and our Empire is safe once more. But discontent is growing in the Roman lands and the position of the Basileus is balancing on the edge. Maybe we could benefit from that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_536;Take them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_536;Macedonia will be more than enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_536;We should be grateful for what we have;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_537;A Christian monk by the name of Sigfrid has arrived from the Catholic churches of Västergotland. He would like to preach at Your court and show You the benefits of Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_537;What can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_538;Sigfrid has continued preaching his religion in our capital, and he seems to be gathering a larger and larger audience. After listening to one of his sermons, you have to admit that the new faith may have some advantages...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_538;It is for the good of the realm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_538;We shall bow to none!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_539;Swedish King Converts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_539;The Pagan King of Sweden has decided to be baptized by Siegfried of Glastonbury and converted to Christianity. It looks like that the era of the Old Gods is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_539;What's that noise? Oh, that is Valhalla crumbling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_541;Fall of the Córdoban Caliphate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_541;A messenger has arrived from Iberia - the last remnants of the Caliphate of Córdoba has been destroyed. It was the last bastion of the Umayyad Empire, the greatest Muslim realm the world has ever seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_541;So it goes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_542;Fall of the Caliphate of Cairo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_542;A messenger has arrived from Egypt - the last remnants of the Caliphate of Cairo, an Empire created by the Fatimids has fallen to obscurity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_543;The forces you ordered to assemble are now ready to invade the Kingdom of England. We shall teach the Anglo-Saxons a lesson they will not forget!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_543;To the longships!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_543;I've changed my mind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_544;My King! The dreadful Norse ruler of Denmark, vile Sweyn Forkbeard has finished consolidating his gains in Norway and now he has stated that he is going to invade England as many Vikings have done before…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_545;After years of careful planning, Olaf Haraldsson, the last male descendant of Harald Fairhair has raised a large army of exiles, mercenaries and hopefuls, declaring intention to retake the Crown of Norway by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_547;A papal bull has arrived demanding the return of Holy Rome to the Papacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_547;Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_547;Refuse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_549;Attacking [From.GetTitledName] may be a mistake -- as the head of the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, [From.GetSheHe] has the right to excommunicate us...a right [From.GetSheHe] has now chosen to exercise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_549;That won't stop me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_550;[rightful_relhead.GetTitledName] has sent a formal request that we aid [rightful_relhead.GetHerHim] in [rightful_relhead.GetHerHis] war against [relhead_enemy.GetTitledName]. As a righteous [Root.Religion.GetName], it is my duty to protect the [rightful_relhead.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]...or is it? What could [rightful_relhead.GetSheHe] truly do if I refuse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_550;We will defend the [rightful_relhead.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_550;We will send volunteers and donations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_550;I see no reason to get involved;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_550;We will donate to the [rightful_relhead.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s cause;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_553;The Bræðralag Founded;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_553;We have founded the Bræðralag, a fellowship of sworn brethren fighting for a place in Valhalla!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_554;The Bræðralag;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_554;The Bræðralag are proud heathen warriors who swear oaths of brotherhood to each other, and swear to fight until they please Oðinn and the heathen gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_554;Their place in Valhalla is assured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_554;More barbaric miscreants to be slaughtered...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_555;The Jomsvikings Founded;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_555;We have founded the Jomsvikings, a brotherhood of berserker warriors who wear wolf-skins and unleash their fury on the enemies of the Norse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_556;The Jomsvikings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_556;A band of fierce Vikings have established a warrior brotherhood. These Jomsvikings are devoted to Thor, Odin and the other Norse gods. They brook no quarter on the battlefield and will permit only the strongest and ablest warriors amongst their number.\n\nThough there are those who would dismiss them as simple brigands, the Jomsvikings have vowed to defend all Norse lands being encroached by Christendom or other foreign religions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_557;Now that control of the kingdom has left Basque hands, a new name should be decided for this kingdom. Yourself and your council have decided on the name Navarra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_557;The Kingdom of Nevarra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_558;Now that the war is over, and [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has handed out titles to deserving generals, the Magyar soldiers have largely disbanded and have begun to settle into their new homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_558;This is our home, now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_560;The Harii;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_560;We have refounded the Harii, a fierce order of Germanic warriors who held back the Romans in ancient days. They will be used against enemies of the faith again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_561;The Harii Founded;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_561;The Harii have been refounded. These Germanic warriors once held back the Roman Empire and are loyal to their pagan faith. They will fight their enemies to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_561;They honor their ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_562;[From.GetTitledName] has issued a call that [Root.GetTitledName] has become decadent and corrupt, and that neither he nor his descendants deserve to hold the [From.Religion.GetName] Caliphate. Whether [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will make a move against the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_562;How dare he!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_562;This is how it must be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_562;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is absolutely right;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_562;No, I support [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_562;This is none of my concern;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_563;The High King of Ireland is traditionally held by an Irish king who can prove dominance over the others. [From.GetTitledName] has declared that [From.GetSheHe] is more deserving of the title than [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], and intends to press [From.GetHerHis] claim to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_563;I dare [From.GetHerHim] to try!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_564;The Rise of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_564;[Root.GetBestName] has proven himself a capable warrior, to the point that he has inspired his [Root.Culture.GetName] followers to assemble their clans and follow him as their nomadic leader. Nearby rulers are already fearing what this could mean to the balance of power in their region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_564;Let all tremble before us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_600;I have assembled the lords and ladies of the [changed_title.GetFullName] to vote on my proposed Succession Law change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_601;I have decided to institute the Gavelkind Succession Law in the [changed_title.GetFullName]. All that is needed is the support of yourself and my other loyal vassals.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_601;Approve;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_601;Ignore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_602;I have decided to institute the Primogeniture Succession Law in the [changed_title.GetFullName]. All that is needed is the support of yourself and my other loyal vassals.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_603;I have decided to institute the Seniority Succession Law in the [changed_title.GetFullName]. All that is needed is the support of yourself and my other loyal vassals.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_605;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has made a change to the [emf_succ_title.GetFullName]'s succession laws... a change which has ensured that not only are you no longer the heir, you are no longer even considered a contender for succession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_605;So be it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_605;How dare [From.GetSheHe]! This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_606;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has made a change to the [emf_succ_title.GetFullName]'s succession laws... a change which has ensured that you are no longer [From.GetHerHis] primary heir, even though you are still considered a candidate for succession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_608;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has made a change to the [emf_succ_title.GetFullName]'s succession laws... a change which has elevated me to the status of [From.GetHerHis] primary heir. Be careful of the jealous eyes now cast your way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_609;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has made a change to the [emf_succ_title.GetFullName]'s succession laws... a change which, while it has not made me [From.GetHerHis] heir, has put me in the immediate line for succession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_610;The results of the vote on my proposed Succession Law change in the [FromFrom.GetFullName] are in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_610;The proposal was approved;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_611;The Succession Law change proposed by [From.GetTitledName] was approved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_612;The Succession Law change proposed by [From.GetTitledName] was rejected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_Plus_613;With my assumption of my distant [GetFromFromRelation]'s throne in the [From.GetFullBaseName], there are already those calling me the first of a new House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_Plus_613;With my violent seizure of my [GetFromFromRelation]'s throne in the [From.GetFullBaseName], there are already those calling me the first of a new House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_613;Yes, establish a new dynasty in [From.GetBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_613;No, emphasize our ties to House [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_614;[From.GetTitledName] has taken the throne in the [From.GetFullBaseName] and established the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty as a cadet branch of the [FromFromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_615;I have decided to institute the Tanistry Succession Law in the [changed_title.GetFullName]. All that is needed is the support of yourself and my other loyal vassals.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_616;I have decided to institute the Feudal Elective Succession Law in the [changed_title.GetFullName]. All that is needed is the support of yourself and my other loyal vassals.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_620;Like the Pharaohs of ancient times, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetPossPronoun] [GetFromNewRelation] [New.GetTitledFirstName] have gotten married under the blessed auspices of the gods, ensuring fullness and Order. We can collect a Royal Aid Duty to pay for the ceremonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_625;The Jewish moneylenders are here, reminding me of that loan I took...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_630;We shall all be Sicilian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_630;No, I wish to remain [Root.Culture.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_635;We shall all be Anglo-Norse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_Plus_655;We shall all be Russian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_660;We shall all be Norman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_670;For as long as we have ruled here in [Root.Capital.GetName], we have entrusted the raising of our children to local nursemaids. Our first words would not be [Root.Culture.GetName] but [melting_pot_province.Culture.GetName]. As we grew up, we learned to speak a tongue that was neither one nor the other but a syncretic mix of the two. Perhaps it is time to embrace this new tongue so we all may communicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_671;It seems that this new [new_culture.Culture.GetName] language has now spread into [Root.GetName], a new culture born from a mix of the old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_672;Although many dislike change, this new [Root.Culture.GetName] language does have a certain functionality that cannot be denied. I have therefore prevailed upon a member of my court to adopt this for everyday administrative use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_700;The Jewish Community that I am sheltering has prospered and grown under my benevolent rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_701;My liege, I bring news from the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. The Jewish merchants that you wisely allowed to settle in the city have grown fat and prosperous under your benevolent rule, and you can expect increased revenue from the taxes and tariffs imposed on their community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_703;A skilled advisor from the Jewish Community I am sheltering has made his services available to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_704;A group of Jewish refugees from distant lands have come to my court. They are seeking a new a place to live after being expelled from their former homes and ask for my permission to establish a community in one of my cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_704;They are welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_704;Tell them to move on;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_705;[From.GetTitledName] has decreed that all Jews in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are to be expelled from the realm and their assets seized by the crown. This includes my own Jewish subjects, who I have no choice but to banish unless I want to openly defy my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_705;Bow to [From.GetHerHis] demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_705;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_730;I have been excommunicated for the sin of dishonorable murder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_731;Being known as a dishonorable murderer is causing me severe mentral stress. Can I really live with what I've done?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_731;The guilt weighs heavily upon me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_731;I'm handling it just fine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_731;I have no regrets;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_732;I was listening in on my courtiers' conversation when I heard one of them call me a murderer. They are clearly working with my enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_733;They must die! They must all die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_800;Your fallen enemy lies before you, he was a valiant foe and his head will make a great trophy to prove your valor to the gods. Grasping your blade firmly, you sever his head from the rest of his body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_800;For [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_801;The gods must favor you, for again you are blessed with victory! As you sever your foe's head from the rest of his body, you hear a bard singing the song of Cu Chullain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_801;He will have a new hero to sing about now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_900;I have served my liege loyally. Perhaps I should try to make friends with [Root.Liege.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_900;Let's try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_900;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_901;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], approached me after a council meeting today and asking me to join [From.GetHerHim] for supper. We both had a grand time, and I think perhaps I should continue to spend time with [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_901;Let's be friends, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_901;[This.GetTitle]s have no friends. Only subjects and enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_902;I dined with my liege and now the two of us have agreed to go meet again within the fortnight. I think this is the beginning to a beautiful friendship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_903;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I had a great time at supper, but [From.GetSheHe] refused my kind offer to meet again. Perhaps another time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_905;I feel the need to talk to someone. Perhaps one of my courtiers will entertain me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_905;Let's see what they have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_905;I'm not interested in these people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_906;[From.GetTitledFirstName] came by to talk with me today. We discussed many interesting subjects and [From.GetSheHe] seemed quite pleased. [From.GetSheHe] suggested that perhaps we should meet for a bottle of wine sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_906;That sounds great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_906;Perhaps another time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_907;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was interesting to talk to, and [From.GetSheHe] responded positively to the suggestion that we should drink together. I think I've made a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_908;[From.GetTitledFirstName] didn't seem too interested in being friends. Oh well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_910;My liege seems bored these days. Perhaps I should invite [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] to practice fencing with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_911;I was sitting alone when [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me if I wanted to spar with [From.GetHerHim]. I had a lot of fun... perhaps I should consider training with [From.GetHerHim] more often?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_912;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I became friends, and I have taught [From.GetHerHim] how to fight better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_913;[From.GetTitledFirstName] didn't want to become a duelist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_915;I feel the need to talk to someone. Perhaps one of my liege's courtiers will entertain me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_916;[From.GetTitledFirstName] came by to talk with me today.  We discussed many interesting subjects and [From.GetFirstName] seemed to be quite pleased.  [From.GetSheHe] suggested perhaps we should meet for a bottle of wine sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_917;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was interesting to talk to, and [From.GetSheHe] responded positively to the suggestion that we should drink together. I think I've made a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_918;[From.GetTitledFirstName] didn't seem to interested in being friends. Oh well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_920;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s current regent is not suitable. I should be regent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_925;You have grown tired of being called '[Root.GetFirstNameWithNick]', and have insisted nobody call you that in your presence. Your councillors tell you it might be possible to get the commoners to stop using the nickname, but there's no guarantee they won't simply take up calling you by it again later. One's reputation cannot be controlled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_925;Just make them stop;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_925;Punish anyone who utters it—that will do the trick;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_925;Do whatever you have to, I don't care;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_925;Perhaps I should let it go...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_926;It took some time, but it seems the discouragement has paid off. Nobody calls you '[Root.GetFirstNameWithNick]' anymore... though how long that'll last is hard to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_927;There was a certain amount of 'persuasion' required, but eventually the commoners started calling you by your proper name again. Should they forget later, perhaps another reminder will be necessary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_928;For a time, it seemed like your efforts were successful... until you hear one of your courtiers slips up and calls you '[Root.GetFirstNameWithNick]' by accident. This will clearly take more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_928;Then we will take the time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_950;Inadequate soil preparation in §Y[Root.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_951;Poor seed selection hurts farming in §Y[Root.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_952;Lack of manure hurts farming in §Y[Root.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_953;Lower mean temperature hurts farming in §Y[Root.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_954;Arable land deserted in §Y[Root.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_955;Draining of marshes and fens in §Y[Root.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_956;Resettlement on newly claimed land in §Y[Root.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_957;Increased land productivity in §Y[Root.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_958;Pillaging;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_958;Sieges could drag on for months and even years, and the besieging troops had to forage the countryside for supplies. These foraging parties could sometimes devolve into looting and outright vandalism. This was the case in [besieged_settlement_province.GetName], where our troops have have pillaged and torched one of the province's buildings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_958;It can't be helped;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_959;The besieging troops have destroyed a building in [besieged_settlement.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_960;Word travels swiftly through [Root.GetName] as your soldiers approach, and the [Root.Religion.GetName] faithful gather in large groups. They are terrified, but ready to resist should you give your men the order...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_960;They will be given to [Root.Owner.Religion.GetHighGodName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_960;Perhaps not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_970;Automatic Distribution of Titles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_970;1) Right-click on the county's coat of arms and use the 'Raise Banner in X' option to flag holdings in that province as ones you want to keep. You can use the 'Lower Banner in X' option  to unflag provinces.\n\n2) Use either the 'Distribute All Barony Tier Holdings' or 'Distribute All Holdings' decision to hand out all non-flagged titles to random rulers.\n\n3) Use the 'End Distribution of Titles' decision to clear the other decisions from your list and to remove all existing flags.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_970;I understand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_974;'My [Root.GetLordLady], the titles to the counties and baronies have been distributed, as per your orders. I trust the candidates are to your satisfaction.' -- Signed, [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_974;I'm certain they are;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_975;'My [Root.GetLordLady], the titles to the baronies have been distributed, as per your orders. I trust the candidates are to your satisfaction.' -- Signed, [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_975;I'm certain they are;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_985;I will pay for my freedom, if I can afford it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_985;I will not pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_985;[Root.Host.GetTitledFirstName] offered to release me from prison if I pay a ransom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_986;We have received a ransom demand from [FromFrom.GetTitledName] for the safe return of [From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_986;I will pay to get them back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_986;I will not pay to get them back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_987;The ransom has been denied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_987;Well, let them rot...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_991;You have chosen to become part of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty. What relation will [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] be to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_991;[From.GetSheHeCap] will be my [From.GetFatherMother];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_991_brother;He will be my brother;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_991_sister;She will be my sister;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_991_nephew;He will be my nephew;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_991_niece;She will be my niece;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_991_uncle;He will be my uncle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_991_aunt;She will be my aunt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_991;We will be only distantly related;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_Plus_991;I've changed my mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1001;[From.Siege.GetName] Besieged;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1001;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], an enemy host is approaching [From.Siege.GetName] with the intent to besiege it. If you wish to flee to safety, you must do so quickly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1001_prisoner;You can hear the sounds of battle from your prison cell. Could it be? Is [From.Siege.GetName] being besieged?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1001_incapable;In your addled state, you can barely understand what is going on. [From.Siege.GetName] is being attacked? By whom?! People are urgently ushering you through the halls, and there is shouting everywhere. Where are they taking you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1001_child;The grown-ups at [From.Siege.GetName] seem awfully nervous. An army is coming, they say, and they intend to send you somewhere safe. It makes no sense to you. Isn't [From.Siege.GetName] the safest place in the entire world?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1001_away;Word has reached you in [Root.Location.GetName] that the enemy has attacked [From.Siege.GetName]. How long it can withstand the siege is uncertain, but with any luck it will be long enough to protect your loved ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1001;I hope they get everyone to safety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1001_prisoner;Sadly, there is nothing I can do from here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1001_incapable;Run? Run now? Where are we going?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1001_child;They never tell me anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1001_alone;I must get to safety at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1001_family;*My* safety is all that matters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1001;I am not leaving without my family;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1001_family;Send my family to safety - I must defend [From.Siege.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1001_alone;I am not going anywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1005;Escape Attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1005;My [Root.GetLordLady], if [Root.Siege.GetName] falls into the hands of the enemy, you could be placed into jeopardy. If you are going to attempt an escape, it must be now. We will not get another chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1005;Slip out a postern door at midnight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1005;Brave the sewers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1005;Just give me a rope...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1005;I think it's better we wait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1006;Just as I thought I had made it to freedom, a group of armed men appear under the banner of my foe.  Exhausted from my escape, it is all I can do to croak the word 'yield.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1007;In the dead of night, as a low mist hung about the curtain wall, you creep out a postern door and float across the moat on an inflated sheepskin.  It's only by the ineptitude of the enemy watch that you stagger, dripping wet, through the siege lines and to the safety of a nearby wood.  Thanks be to God! ... Although any family left behind is likely angry with us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1008;Your steward leads you down into the store rooms to a passage you didn't even know existed.  Beyond it, a dismal tunnel full of death and decay, and you are only too glad to reach the moat and relatively fresh water. I hope I never have to do that again!  It only now occurs to me that any family left behind is likely angry with me for leaving them in the hands of the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1009;They said only a lunatic would attempt climbing down the southeast wall, and certainly the enemy agreed!  A near thing, too, when my foot slipped on that patch of moss.  My brush with death over with, and safety assured, it only now occurs to me that any family left behind will see this as a desertion, not a bold deed of heroism...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1010;My [Root.GetLordLady], we've caught [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] while [From.GetSheHe] was trying to sneak out of the castle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1010;Take [From.GetHerHim] back to my dungeons immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1021;My [Root.GetLordLady], we've finally taken [FromFrom.GetName]... and it appears [FromFrom.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] numbers among those within. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1021;Take [siege_owner.GetHerHim] prisoner at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1021;Imprison [siege_owner.GetHerHim] and anyone else we find;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1021;Kill [siege_owner.GetHerHim] and anyone else within;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1021;Leave [siege_owner.GetHerHim] and [siege_owner.GetHerHis] family be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1022;My [Root.GetLordLady], we've finally taken [FromFrom.GetName]... but it appears [FromFrom.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has gone into hiding. We can search for [FromFrom.Holder.GetHerHim], but [FromFrom.Holder.GetSheHe] will not be easy to find. What would you have us do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1022;Find [FromFrom.Holder.GetHerHim]—[FromFrom.Holder.GetSheHe]'s the only one we want;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1022;Find [FromFrom.Holder.GetHerHim] and anyone else of importance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1022;Kill everyone you can find;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1023;My [Root.GetLordLady], we've finally taken [FromFrom.GetName], and it appears that [FromFrom.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] may have family within... though some may have gone into hiding. If they have, they may not be very easy to find. What would you have us do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1023;Imprison anyone of importance you can find;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1023;Leave them be, they are unimportant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1024;My [Root.GetLordLady], our forces report that [FromFrom.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has prisoners being held at [FromFrom.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1024;Release all prisoners;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1024;Transfer them to MY dungeon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1024;Release anyone with whom we have common cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1024;Release only my relatives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_1024;Whoever these people are, they smell like they belong there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1026;As the forces of [siege_attacker.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] finally burst through the gates of [FromFromFrom.GetName], you assumed they would take you prisoner if they found you... but that was not to be. You heard the screams before they reached you, and, upon realizing they were slaughtering everyone, you tried to flee. Eventually they caught up to you and summarily put you to the sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1026;I will be avenged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1027;As the forces of [siege_attacker.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] finally burst through the gates of [siege_holding.GetName], you attempted to evade them... but ultimately were unsuccessful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1029;After the siege, we found §Y[From.GetTitledName]§! and immediately took [From.GetHerHim] prisoner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1031;We have finally taken [FromFrom.GetName], and the men are already busy looting and setting fires. A glorious day! I know the men are ready to slake their bloody thirsts upon the holding. What instructions shall I give them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1031;Tell them to control themselves—I want prisoners;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1031;No, let them celebrate their victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1031;Tonight we offer sacrifices to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1032;As the attackers finally burst through the gates of [siege_holding.GetName], you attempted to evade them... and, while you were ultimately successful in escaping, you did not do so unscathed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1032;At least I got away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1033;As the forces of [siege_attacker.GetTitledFirstName] finally burst through the gates of [siege_holding.GetName], you assumed they would take you prisoner if they found you... but that was not to be. Once you saw the daggers, and heard their horrid chanting, you realized with horror that they were going to sacrifice you to their pagan gods...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1100;Your council gathers as you inform them of your decision to disinherit [From.GetTitledFirstName]. While the reasoning is obvious to everyone, their somber faces betray the fact this is not something to be lightly considered. [From.GetFirstName] could take up arms against you, after all, and many of your vassals would consider [From.GetHerHis] position completely justified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1100;I have considered the matter carefully—let it be done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1100;I doubt [From.GetSheHe] will even understand what has happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1100;[From.GetSheHeCap] is in prison—what could [From.GetSheHe] do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1100;Perhaps not, then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1101;News has spread throughout the realm that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has declared [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] unfit to inherit the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], even though the law of the land states that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] should. Everyone knows the reason, but many are saying it doesn't seem right that the law should be ignored... even by the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1101;Actually, [From.GetSheHe] IS the law;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1101;I feel for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], but that is how it is;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1101;This is an outrage! [From.GetTitledFirstName] has no right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1105;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has declared you unfit to inherit [From.GetHerHis] titles, even though the laws of the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] say that I am. It is only [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s great prestige that allows this, although it is certain many of [From.GetHerHis] vassals would be sympathetic to your cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1105;Disappointing, but truly I am relieved;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1105;Look for support in dealing with this outrage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1105;I will become [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], no matter what [From.GetSheHe] says!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1106;My [Root.GetLordLady], I am certain you have heard the recent news regarding my disinheritance. I consider this an illegal act, and since I understand you to be sympathetic regarding my cause I will join your court while I consider my options. -- Yours in thanks, [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1106;We are pleased to welcome [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1106;If [From.GetSheHe] must come here, then so be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1110;While you can barely understand in your current state, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has declared you unfit to inherit [From.GetHerHis] titles. People around you are talking about this, and some are angry, but it's simply too dizzying to think about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1110;Maybe it's for the best;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1115;Languishing in prison as you are, it's several days before you hear the news that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has declared you unfit to inherit [From.GetHerHis] titles, even though the laws of the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] say it should be so. As unsurprised as you are, you know there are those who would support you... if you could ever get out of here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1115;There will be a reckoning once I am free;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1120;The situation with [From.GetTitledFirstName] has changed, and perhaps the time has come for a reconciliation. It will not be easy, of course... your council hums and haws over the idea of you going back on your decree, as lingering bad feelings will persist regardless, but it is possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1120;He is my son--that is all that matters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1120;She is my daughter--that is all that matters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1120;Perhaps they are right;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1121;Some good news! The bad blood between [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has been settled, with [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] being granted full inheritance rights once again... even if some are grumbling at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s arbitrary decrees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1121;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] should be pleased, at least;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1125;It appears the impossible has happened: [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to reconcile, and has decreed that you once again enjoy full inheritance rights in the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1131;With the recent death of [From.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] decree regarding your inheritance rights no longer applies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1131;[From.GetSheHeCap] will not be missed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1152;A New Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1152;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has assumed the throne of the Carolingian Empire... and now it falls to you to decide whether you will accept [From.GetHerHis] rule, or whether you will break the oaths of fealty and declare independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1152;The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] will find its own path;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1152;[From.GetSheHeCap] is my emperor, and all of ours;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1153;My [Root.GetLordLady] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt is my position that the Carolingian Empire is a legacy deserving of the likes of Charlemagne, and requires a ruler of sufficient substance and character to earn its support. I believe that ruler is not you, and thus the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] hereby declares its independence from the empire. We will find our own way from this day on.\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1153;An outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1157;The Holy Roman Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1157;To the most devout and serene [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nIn the name of the Lord, I, [From.GetTitledName], agree to offer my blessing and will anoint you as Holy Roman Emperor. May your rule be both just and eternal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1158;'In the name of Christ, I, [From.GetTitledFirstName], promise, pledge and guarantee in the sight of God and the blessed Apostle Peter that I will be the protector and defender of this holy Roman Church in all ways useful to her, however many, in so far as I am supported by divine assistance according to my knowledge and ability.'\n\nToday [From.GetTitledFirstName] was crowned by his Holiness the Pope and formally received the title of Holy Roman Emperor and the Imperial Regalia with the blessing of the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1159;Offer to become [From.GetHerHis] devout vassal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1159;Wish [From.GetHerHim] well;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1160;To [Root.GetHerHisCap] Imperial Majesty, [Root.GetTitledName],\nI offer my congratulations on your coronation, and, as a loyal subject to [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName], I hereby offer you my devout oath of fealty. Let the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] become part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nSigned in faith,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1160;Accept [From.GetHerHis] oath of fealty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1160;No, I don't want [From.GetHerHim] as a vassal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1161;The Carolingian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1161;The throne of the Carolingian Empire is not an easy thing to hold. Its vassals are notoriously independent, and as each generation of rulers gets further from Charlemagne, their memory of what the throne stands for growns more distant. For now, at least, your rule appears to be safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1162;End of the Carolingian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1162;Though you recently assumed the Carolingian throne, it appears it is not yours to hold. The Pope has refused to anoint you with his blessing, and indeed there are far too many who consider the throne to exist only in name. To them, you claim of the imperial title is meaningless. The once-great empire of Charlemagne has fallen to chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1162;No! This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1163;While [From.GetTitledFirstName] has assumed the throne of the Carolingian Empire, it appears that far too many consider [From.GetHerHis] title to exist purely in name. The Pope has refused to anoint [From.GetHerHim] with his blessing, and thus the once-great empire of Charlemagne has fallen to chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1163;This is terrible news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1163;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1164;Part of the agreement made between [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [current_pope.GetTitledFirstName] for [From.GetHerHis] coronation was the turning over of certain lands in central Italy to the Pope's control -- lands which include part of your domain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1164;What? I never agreed to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1170;Since you are not a subject of the Holy Roman Empire, some of your titles have become de facto kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1171;Under the laws of the Holy Roman Empire, some of your titles have been demoted to a slightly lesser rank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1175;I expressed my wishes and desires for a coronation in Rome to his holiness the Pope. Hopefully he will accept my request so that I can begin inviting my lords to attend the coronation ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1175;Of course he will accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1176;To the most Reverend and Blessed Apostolic Pope,\n\nI would like to ask you for your blessing in my rule as Emperor-elect by holding officially holding a coronation ceremony in my honour.\n\nYour most devoted subject,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1176;[From.GetFirstName] is deserving of a crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1176;[From.GetFirstName] is no true Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1177;To the most devout and serene [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nIn the name of the Lord, I, [From.GetTitledName], would like to offer you my blessing to allow your coronation in Rome, as [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Emperor, under my guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1177;Excellent, send out the a message to invite all my lords;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1178;To [Root.GetHerHisCap] Majesty [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nIn the name of the Lord, I, [From.GetTitledName], would like to inform you that I deem you are not yet worthy and just enough as a ruler to be offered my blessings to become crowned as the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Emperor. The Lord surely has much faith in you as you have in him, but remember that the honour of receiving His blessing does not come easy and is only for the purest of souls.\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1178;Why can't he ever just say:No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1179;To Noble [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nYou should be happy to know that, I, [From.GetTitledName], will hold a coronation ceremony in Rome in my honour with the blessing of his Holiness the Pope. You received the honour to be invited to attend the ceremony, which will be held soon in Rome. I await your postive reply.\n\nYour most Holy Lord and Liege,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1179;I will attend the ceremony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1179;I refuse to set foot in that pompous windbag's castle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1180;[From.GetTitledName] is sorry to inform you that [From.GetSheHe] will not be able to attend the coronation ceremony in Rome as [From.GetSheHe] has more important issues to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1180;I have no words for such dishonor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1181;Today I was crowned by his Holiness the Pope and formally received the title of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Emperor and the Imperial Regalia with the blessing of the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1181;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1181;This will strengthen my rule significantly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1182;Today [From.GetTitledFirstName] was crowned by his Holiness the Pope and formally received the title of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Emperor and the Imperial Regalia with the blessing of the Pope. The ceremony was magnificent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1182;Long may [From.GetTitledFirstName] live!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1183;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been crowned and received the Imperial Regalia by his holiness the Pope in the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The divine blessings conveyed by his Holiness the Pope confirm the right of rule over all Imperial lands governed by [From.GetTitledFirstName] and his appointed vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1183;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1184;'In the name of Christ, I, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], promise, pledge and guarantee in the sight of God and the blessed Apostle Peter that I will be the protector and defender of this holy Roman Church in all ways useful to her, however many, in so far as I am supported by divine assistance according to my knowledge and ability.'\n\nToday [Root.GetTitledFirstName] was crowned by his Holiness the Pope and formally received the title of Holy Roman Emperor and the Imperial Regalia with the blessing of the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1184;Pope Crowns Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1185;The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] United;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1185;The Kingdom of Aquitaine has been united fully under the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] as a single kingdom, with a single crown, and a single ruler in [Root.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1186;With Lotharingia and Burgundy having fallen under my domain, my relatives are crying foul. They are demanding to meet with me at Meerssen, to create a new treaty to replace the Treaty of Verdun which first split up the Frankish Empire. If I do not, there will be no peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1186;Agree to the new treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1186;No, the inheritance is rightfully mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1187;The Treaty of Meerssen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1187;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has met with his vassals at Meerssen and come up with a new treaty following his inheritance of Lotharingia and Burgundy. This will more equitably split the lands of Lothaire among his heirs, and allow for peace—at least for a time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1188;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has inherited both Lotharingia and Burgundy, lands that were intended to be spread amongst the heirs of Lothaire. [From.GetSheHeCap] has refused to even discuss the issue of inheritance, all but daring his vassals to press the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1188;It is not worth fighting over;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1188;This cannot be allowed to stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1200;I already rule the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], but receiving an official [Root.Religion.GetName] coronation will legitimize my standing to my vassals. Now is the time to begin planning what is sure to be a lavish ceremony, attended by all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1200;I look forward to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1201;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI am pleased to invite you to my forthcoming coronation at [From.Capital.GetName]. There I will be officially crowned as [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in the sight of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], and your presence would be most welcome.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1201;I will gladly attend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1201;I have other things to do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1201;Send an envoy in my stead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1201;Alas, the war detains me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_1201;Alas, I am far too busy at present;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1202;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI am very pleased to accept your invitation, and will be journeying to [Root.Capital.GetName] shortly to personally attend your coronation.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1203;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nWhile I appreciate your invitation, I am afraid I must decline. I trust my presence at the coronation will not be overly missed.\n\nYours,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1204;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI fear I will not be able to personally attend your coronation. An envoy will be sent to [Root.Capital.GetName] in my stead, to stand as a representative of the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1205;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nWhile I would like nothing better than to attend your coronation, I fear the war in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] demands my full attention and thus I will be unable to get away. I wish you well on this auspicious occasion.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1206;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nI am pleased to have received your invitation. Alas, matters in [From.Capital.GetName] already have my commitment, and thus I will be unable to make the journey to [Root.Capital.GetName] in time to attend the coronation. Please accept my apologies and congratulations.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1207;[coronation_liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is planning a proper coronation in the eyes of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], and will require a [Root.Religion.GetName] priest to perform the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1207;I shall be that priest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1208;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nAs you will be holding a proper [Root.Religion.GetName] coronation, I would be pleased to offer my services in performing the ceremony.\n\nMay [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] watch over you,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1208;[From.GetSheHeCap] may perform the ceremony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1208;I will hold out for someone better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1209;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nI would be more than pleased to have you perform the coronation ceremony. Please accept my eternal gratitude.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1210;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nWhile I appreciate your offer, I believe it would be prudent if someone more qualified performed the coronation ceremony.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1210;This is an insult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1211;Sadly, the outbreak of war in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] means that the coronation festivities will have to be cancelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1212;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nSadly, the outbreak of war in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] means that the coronation festivities will have to be cancelled. My apologies for the inconvenience.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1212;That's too bad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1213;With your untimely death, the coronation festivities will clearly need to be cancelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1213;And I was SO close!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1213;And I was JUST coronated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1214;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nSadly, the untimely death of [From.GetTitledName] obviously means that [From.GetHerHis] coronation must hereby be canceled. We regret the inconvenience.\n\nSigned,\nThe Chancellor of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1215;The [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1215;'I, [From.GetFirstName] of the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty, and with the blessing of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], do hereby rightfully assume the crown of the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].'\n\nWith those words does [From.GetSheHe] become [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth, with each of [From.GetHerHis] vassals lining up to bow before [From.GetHerHim] and swear everlasting fealty. It is an impressive ceremony, full of pomp and circumstance, and one that will write [From.GetTitledFirstName] into history. The streets of [From.Capital.GetName] are lined with [From.Capital.Culture.GetName] crowds cheering, with everyone straining to get a look at the important personages that pass by on their way to the forthcoming feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1215;I have never been more proud;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1215;Long live [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1215;I bet the ceremony was nice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1216;With the coronation ceremony finished, the newly-anointed [From.GetTitledFirstName] retired to [From.GetHerHis] castle for the celebration feast. The hall is packed with people: the lords and ladies of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], their wives and husbands, visiting [From.Religion.GetName] rulers and emissaries...it will be a night to remember!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1216;Let the festivities commence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1216;This will be quite the celebration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1217;The coronation feast goes well into the night, and you find yourself frequently spending time with your host, drinking wine and laughing over stories. You leave feeling as if the two of you have gained an excellent understanding of one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1217;I've found a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1218;As the coronation feast continues, you find yourself frequently in the company of [From.GetTitledFirstName], drinking wine and laughing over stories. While you would not have thought so initially, it seems as if the two of you have gained an excellent understanding of one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1219;It was bound to happen. You drank a little too much at the coronation feast, and when you ran into your host you argued over a title they hold which you believe rightfully belongs to you. Heated words were exchanged, to the point where guards had to politely separate the two of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1219;This is not my fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1220;It was bound to happen. [From.GetTitledFirstName] drank too much at the coronation feast, and at one point in the night confronted you. [From.GetHerHisCap] words slurred from drink, [From.GetSheHe] argued with you over a title that you hold which [From.GetSheHe] believes rightfully belongs to [From.GetHerHim]. It caused quite the scene, reaching the point where guards had to politely separate the two of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1220;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1222;You suspected that [challenge_target.GetSheHe] might be at the coronation feast, and sure enough...there [challenge_target.GetTitledFirstName] is, laughing and carrying on. You despise the man, and with a few drinks in you, it occurs to you to challenge him to a duel right here and now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1224;You challenged [From.GetTitledFirstName], but [From.GetSheHe] spluttered excuses regarding how this was a feast and you are both guests and so forth...and declined the challenge, much to his embarrassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1224;The coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1225;A series of shouts arose during the coronation feast, and the guests parted to reveal the culprits: [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] with blade drawn, challenging [From.GetTitledFirstName] to a duel. Both men are ready to fight, and are asking for your leave to settle matters here and now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1225;Absolutely not! This is a feast, not a tavern!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1225;Talk them out of the foolish idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1225;Why not? Some entertainment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1226;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was furious at both of us for daring to ask to duel, all but ordering us out of the feast. We left, more bitter at [From.GetTitledFirstName] than at each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1226;[From.GetSheHeCap] had no right to speak to me in that fashion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1227;[From.GetTitledFirstName] listened to our request to fight, and instead of agreeing took us each aside in turn and spoke to us calmly. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that it would be unfortunate if either of us were hurt, as it would be a breach of hospitality, and begged us to reconsider...and [From.GetSheHe] was right. It was a foolish idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1227;Another time, then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1228;Those at the coronation feast gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledName], overseen by [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetHerHim]self. The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] was stabbed by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] and died!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1228;Most unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1228;The bastard killed me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1228;Ha! [From.GetSheHe] had it coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1228;How scandalous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1229;Those at the coronation feast gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.GetTitledName], overseen by [coronation_duel_host.GetTitledFirstName] [coronation_duel_host.GetHerHim]self. The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] lost the duel and was badly wounded. [From.GetTitledFirstName] is victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1229;There, it is done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1229;[From.GetSheHe] must have cheated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1229;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1230;Those at the coronation feast gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.GetTitledName], overseen by [coronation_duel_host.GetTitledFirstName] [coronation_duel_host.GetHerHim]self. The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] conceded defeat after first blood. [From.GetTitledFirstName] is victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1231;Those at the coronation feast gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.GetTitledName], overseen by [coronation_duel_host.GetTitledFirstName] [coronation_duel_host.GetHerHim]self. The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] was stabbed by [From.GetTitledFirstName] and died!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1232;The coronation feast was going so well...and then you saw [Spouse.GetFirstName]'s lover, there across the room, laughing and as brazen as [Root.GetSheHe] pleased. How could [Spouse.GetSheHe] invite [Root.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1232;[Spouse.GetSheHeCap] does this to spite me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1233;The coronation feast was going so well...and then you saw [From.GetTitledFirstName] staring daggers at you. [From.GetSheHeCap] accosted you in front of your guests, making a scene over the fact your lover was present at the coronation! Eventually [From.GetSheHe] stormed off, but it was an embarrassing moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1233;That could have gone...better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1234;The coronation's festivities are going well...so well, in fact, that the muse has overtaken you. Perhaps an ode to your host, publicly declared for all to hear?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1234;Yes! Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1234;No, I couldn't bear the shame;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1235;At one point in the coronation's festivities, [From.GetTitledName] stands and gets everyone's attention. [From.GetSheHe] delivers a poem in [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s honor...and it is beautiful. Those gathered are moved, and the applause afterwards signifies that this ode will be written down and remembered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1235;Well done, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1235;I couldn't be more pleased;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1235;How fabulous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1236;At one point in the coronation's festivities, [From.GetTitledName] stands and gets everyone's attention. [From.GetSheHe] delivers a poem in [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s honor...and it is terrible. Did [From.GetSheHe] intend to insult [From.GetHerHis] host, or was it an accident? The awkward coughs afterwards signify this moment is best forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1236;Awkward, indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1236;No, this is terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1236;How awful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1238;'To our good host, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], long may [Root.GetSheHe] reign!'\n\n[From.GetTitledName] stands and delivers an eloquent toast in [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s honor at the coronation feast, prompting a round of approving applause from those gathered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1238;Many thanks, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1238;Long may [Root.GetSheHe] reign!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1240;On the night of the coronation feast, it seems everyone wants to dance with you. [From.GetTitledFirstName] in particular, however, seems more interested than most. The way [From.GetSheHe] smiles at you, you suspect [From.GetSheHe] might be interested in more than just a dance with the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1240;Oh, really? Let's see where this goes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1240;A dance is more than sufficient;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1242;On the night of the coronation feast, it seems every [Root.GetManWomanOpp] wishes to dance with you. How tiresome. [From.GetTitledFirstName] winks in your direction, seeming to understand your discomfort. Indeed, you suspect [From.GetSheHe] might understand better than most...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1242;Let's talk in private, [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1242;I'm not interested in [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1244;All throughout the coronation feast, [From.GetTitledName] has done nothing more than make caustic remarks about you when [From.GetSheHe] thinks you're not listening. You're not even certain why [From.GetSheHe] came to the coronation at all, if this is how [From.GetSheHe] feels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1244;Endure it—it's only one evening, after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1244;Confront [From.GetHerHim]—this needs to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1246;As if [From.GetHerHis] drinking weren't bad enough, [From.GetTitledName] managed to make quite the spectacle of [From.GetHerHim]self at the coronation feast, dancing on tables and carrying on until finally [From.GetSheHe] vomited on the floor in front of everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1246;Oh, wonderful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1248;For most of the coronation feast, [From.GetTitledName] acted normally...or as normally as one can expect [From.GetHerHim] to be, perhaps. Then a servant placed the wrong flagon before [From.GetHerHim], and that set [From.GetHerHim] off: ranting and raving, until finally the hall watched in silence as [From.GetSheHe] was escorted away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1248;You could hear [From.GetHerHim] screaming from the halls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1275;The coronation feast finally draws to a close, with [From.GetTitledFirstName] giving a speech to those gathered that is barely heard over the raucous cheering. 'Long live the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]! Long live the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1275;Let's hope so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1275;A fine event, indeed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1300;The Empire Flourishes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1300;With [Root.GetTitledFirstName] sitting upon its throne in [Root.Capital.GetName], the Byzantine Empire is still flourishing and has only just begun to show signs of decadence. With the grace of God, [Root.GetSheHe] will be able to maintain its might and perhaps even restore the Roman Empire to its proper place in the civilized world once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1300;Long live the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1301;The Empire Cracks at the Seams;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1301;With [Root.GetTitledFirstName] currently sitting upon its throne in [Root.Capital.GetName], the Byzantine Empire is beginning to crack at the seams. Too many wars that should have been won have instead been lost through mismanagement and decadence, and there are those who say its time is nearing an end. With the grace of God, the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] will be able to reverse this trend and resture the might of the Roman Empire that once was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1302;The Empire is Falling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1302;With [Root.GetTitledFirstName] currently sitting upon its throne in [Root.Capital.GetName], the Byzantine Empire is in a state of chaos. War after war against the infidels has been lost, and there are those who say it would take the grace of God Himself for the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] to shrug off the decadence of [Root.GetHerHis] court and restore what once was. The might of the Roman Empire of old seems but a distant dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1303;The Empire is Shattered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1303;With [Root.GetTitledFirstName] currently sitting upon its throne in [Root.Capital.GetName], the once-mighty Byzantine Empire is a shadow of its former grace. The court of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] has become decadent and corrupt, and there are many who question the possibility of the empire's mere survival, never mind dream of restoring the Roman Empire that once was. We pray for the grace of God to be bestowed upon the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] in this, our empire's hour of greatest need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1305;The Byzantine Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1305;The Eastern Roman Empire has resisted the slow decay and corruption of its power throughout the Dark Ages, but now it seems entropy has finally taken its toll. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] watches from [Root.GetHerHis] throne in [Root.Capital.GetName] as all of Anatolia slips from the empire's grasp, a sure sign of just how far it has fallen from grace. Many within the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s court are already questioning whether it is even possible for the empire to survive the coming days. Whatever the truth, it will take the grace of God Himself to see [Root.GetTitledFirstName] through these dark days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1305;God have mercy on us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1305;Welcome to the deep end;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1306;Collapse of Anatolia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1306;With the eastern provinces in Armenia having been conquered by the Seljuks, the authority of the Byzantine Empire over all of Asia Minor has rapidly begun to crumble. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] watches helplessly from [Root.GetHerHis] throne in [Root.Capital.GetName] as a muslim warlord establishes the so-called 'Sultanate of Rûm' in lands that were, until recently, rightfully [Root.GetHersHis]. Whether the empire will be able to recover from this crippling blow remains to be seen, but all of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s court fervently prays for the grace of God to shine on [Root.GetHerHim] in this, [Root.GetHerHis] darkest hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1307;We have fended off the barbarians from the East as we have done many times before. The Empire once again stands victorious and the crisis is averted…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1307;How else could it possibly have ended?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1308;Word has reached your ears that [From.GetBestName] has been spreading word regarding [From.GetHerHis] claim to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] throne. According to [From.GetHerHim], you are a corrupt ruler who is weakening the empire, and only [From.GetSheHe] can lead it to greatness. Perhaps this is just an exaggeration?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1308;We shall see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1310;Even though you have inherited the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] by the right of feudal succession, your sovereignty is not guaranteed until it is confirmed by the current Basileus. [Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] has the right to take your title away, if [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1310;The Basileus has no rights whatsover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1310;Let [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] decide our fate, then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1310;Flatter and soothe [Root.Liege.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1310;Crawl before [Root.Liege.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_1310;Maybe a pile of gold?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1311;My glorious liege,\nI have become the new governor of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and I hereby request that you to allow me to retain the title.\n\nYour humble vassal,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1311;I will not take away [From.GetHerHis] title;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1311;No, [From.GetSheHe] may not keep it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1312;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], I have decided that you shall serve me faithfully as the governor of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1312;The right decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1313;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI have decided you are not worthy of commanding the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. I expect you to step down peacefully...there are many ways to serve your Basileus, but this shall not be one of them.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1313;Over the dead, cold bodies of my serfs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1313;I surrender to the will of my liege;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1314;My glorious liege,\nI have become the new governor of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and I beg you to allow me to keep it. I hope that you will take everything into consideration when you make your decision.\n\nYour humble vassal,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1315;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nYou dare! These lands belong to me by right! If you want them, you shall have to wrest them from me on the field of battle!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1315;Then war it is;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1316;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has accepted your decision and agreed to give up his theme. Now the only question which remains: to whom shall you grant it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1316;To the Imperial Strategos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1316;To my beloved Regent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1316;To a member of my council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1316;To an Imperial dignitary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_1316;To a relative;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_Plus_1316;To myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_Plus_1316;To anyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1320;While you have ascended onto the Byzantine throne, the empire will remain in a period of transition that will last until your proper coronation by the Ecumenical Patriarch. It is best you do so quickly, lest imperial authority begin to degrade in the meantime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1320;I am the rightful sovereign of all Romans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1321;The new ruler of the Byzantine Empire demands you coronate him the rightful ruler of all the Romans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1321;[From.GetTitledFirstName] shall wear the Imperial crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1321;No, [From.GetSheHe] is unworthy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1322;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to coronate you as the rightful ruler and thus solidify your hold on the throne. Let the preparations for the ceremony begin…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1323;To the noble [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nYou should be happy to know that, I, [From.GetTitledFirstName], will hold a coronation ceremony in my honour with the blessing of [FromFrom.GetTitledName]. You have the honour to be invited to attend the coronation, to be held soon in [From.Capital.GetName]. I await your postive reply.\n\nYour Lord and Liege,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1324;The ceremonies are in full swing and the fate of [From.GetTitledFirstName] is being determined - will [From.GetSheHe] continue the inevitable decay of the Roman Empire, or will [From.GetSheHe] stop its advance? It is for you to decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1324;And strong [From.GetSheHe] shall be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1324;Sadly, [From.GetSheHe] is just another decadent brat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1325;Emperor of the Romans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1325;For centuries the magnificent Constantinople, Queen of the Cities, was a capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. Today this glorious city is full of joy - a new ruler ascends to the throne and a magnificent coronation takes place in the Hagia Sophia.\n\n'In the name of Iesous Christos Pantocrator, Lord of the Kosmos, I, [Root.GetFirstName], accept the Imperial Crown from the hands of [From.GetFirstName], Patriarch of Konstantinoupolis, and solemnly swear before the Senate and People of Rome as your [Root.GetTitle] to rule with justness, fairness and divine guidance, to protect this Holy Church from all evil and, by the grace of our Savior, to never let the light of our True Faith and this Basileia Rhomaion to dim. So help me God!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1325;Glorious your reign shall be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1325;Long live the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1326;[From.GetTitledName] crowned you in Hagia Sofia with all the pomp and ceremony due your station, but the air is regrettably one of formality. You get the definite sense that nobody quite believes you are the [Root.GetManWoman] to restore greatness to the Eastern Roman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1326;I still get to wear the crown, don't I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1327;'In the name of Iesous Christos Pantocrator, Lord of the Kosmos, I, [Root.GetFirstName], accept the Imperial Crown from the hands of [FromFrom.GetFirstName], Patriarch of Konstantinoupolis, and solemnly swear before the Senate and People of Rome as your [Root.GetTitle] to rule with justness, fairness and divine guidance, to protect this Holy Church from all evil and, by the grace of our Savior, to never let the light of our True Faith and this Basileia Rhomaion to dim. So help me God!'\n\nWith those words does [From.GetSheHe] become [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth, with each of [From.GetHerHis] vassals lining up to bow before [From.GetHerHim] and swear everlasting fealty. It is an impressive ceremony, full of pomp and circumstance...though there is a lingering feeling among those present that they are witnessing not a resurgence of the empire's greatness, but simply one more step in its inevitable decline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1327;Too bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1328;The traitorous [From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused to crown you! You can, of course, depose him and appoint someone more loyal to perform the coronation, but that probably won't be seen in a very favorable light by the faithful. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1328;Let's show [From.GetHerHim] some caesaropapism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1328;I will bow before the will of God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1338;The Ascension of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1338;While some initially considered [Root.GetHerHim] to be a weak ruler, perhaps one destined to be lost in the history books, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has proven [Root.GetHerHim]self over the last years of [Root.GetHerHis] rule to be effective...so much so that some in the Byzantine Empire are now whispering [Root.GetHerHis] name in the same tones once reserved for the great emperors of times past. There is a renewed belief that [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will lead the empire onto a great path, perhaps even all the way to the restoration of the Roman Empire of old!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1338;I certainly hope so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1338;Long live the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1338;We shall see;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1350;I have been gearing up for this confrontation for some time now. I have gained an audience, and will ask my father to recognize me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1350;It's now or never...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1351;It was rather unexpected when [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked for an audience, but when [From.GetSheHe] arrived [From.GetSheHe] explained that [From.GetSheHe] is a fully-grown [From.GetManWoman]...one that [From.GetSheHe] hopes is worthy of being considered your legitimate [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1351;That is not going to happen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1351;Convince [From.GetHerHim] why this cannot be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1351;Refuse, but buy [From.GetHerHim] an estate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1351;Legitimize [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1352;[From.GetTitledFirstName] shook his head. 'No,' he said. 'That is simply never going to happen. Put it out of your head.' Then he had me escorted from the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1352;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1352;This isn't right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1353;[From.GetTitledFirstName] listened to me for some time, and then he sat me down and we talked at length. He explained the political realities in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and why legitimizing me would complicate things. I'm disappointed, but I do see the truth in his words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1354;[From.GetTitledFirstName] listened to my plea for some time. While he ultimately did refuse to legitimize me, he offered me an estate off of which to live. It will make me a [Root.GetLordLady] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], but is that enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1354;No, it's not enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1355;'Know that I, [From.GetTitledName], hereby consider [Root.GetTitledFirstName] to be my legitimate child and to be considered such throughout [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. [Root.GetSheHeCap] will take [Root.GetHerHis] rightful place within the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty and among my heirs. By the grace of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] shall this be so.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1361;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has inherited the [FromFrom.GetFullName], a title that should rightfully belong to me. I have the feeling that many of [From.GetHerHis] vassals would agree. Perhaps I should make my case to them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1361;[FromFrom.GetName] is rightfully mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1361;No, let [From.GetTitledFirstName] have it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1362;Word reaches you that your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has made a claim against your titles. [From.GetSheHeCap] is trying to win the support of your vassals, and it's possible some of them might actually agree with [From.GetHerHis] cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1362;Damn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1362;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in prison at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1363;Word reaches you that [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has made a claim against [From.GetTitledFirstName], claiming [FromFrom.GetSheHe] should rightfully have been the heir to the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. It is not uncommon for bastards to do this, and you suspect there are some who might agree with [FromFrom.GetHerHis] cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1363;I agree--[FromFrom.GetSheHe] should rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1363;No, I support [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1370;Recently, you discovered that [Root.Father.GetTitledFirstName] was never your father at all. Should you confront your real father and demand the truth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1370;I need to know the truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1370;I am a [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName], and that's all that matters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1371;[From.GetTitledFirstName] recently came to me, saying that [From.GetSheHe] recently learned that [From.Father.GetTitledFirstName] was not, in fact, [From.GetHerHis] real father. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] believes I am. It's true, of course, but now [From.GetSheHe] expects an answer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1371;Tell [From.GetHerHim] the truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1371;Deny it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1371;Convince [From.GetHerHim] it's not true;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1372;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sighed heavily when I confronted him, but eventually nodded. 'I can't be certain,' he admitted, 'but I was close to your mother once, and you were born during that time. You are my child.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1372;Then I want to be recognized as such;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1372;That's all I wanted to know;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1373;I asked [From.GetTitledFirstName] for the truth, and he looked me straight in the eye and said he wasn't my father. It's not true, of course, but obviously he will lie to my face about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1373;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1374;[From.GetTitledFirstName] appeared genuinely confused when I confronted him. 'I knew your mother once, it's true,' he admitted, 'but that's all. [Root.Father.GetTitledFirstName] is surely your father. You even have his look about you.' I felt embarrassed to have even brought it up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1374;I suppose I was mistaken;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1375;To my surprise, [From.GetTitledFirstName] merely nodded and turned to leave after I told [From.GetHerHim] the truth. 'I only wanted to hear it from your own lips,' [From.GetSheHe] said. I wonder if this is the last I will hear of it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1376;[From.GetTitledFirstName] nodded when I told [From.GetHerHim] the truth. 'Then recognize me. If I am truly your kin, I want to be known as such. I have rights, do I not?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1402;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has asked for an audience with you: 'My [Root.GetLordLady], a vision of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] came to me and commanded that I build a temple in [From.GetName]. I will need your help, however, for I'm uncertain I can complete this grand project on my own.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1402;Take this, and my blessing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1402;I shall appeal to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faithful on your behalf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1402;The lords and ladies of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] will all help you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1402;I can spare you nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_1402;I fear I can be of no help to you, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1406;With the death of [From.GetTitledFirstName], so dies [From.GetHerHis] dream of building a new temple in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1408_ruler;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nWould that I could continue construction of the new temple as planned, but my duties in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] take me away from such matters. If you can find another to take my place, I recommend that you do so.\n\nWith great respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1408_incapable;While the construction of the new temple has been ongoing, it seems that [From.GetTitledFirstName] is no longer in any condition to continue it. Many fear that unless [From.GetSheHe] miraculously recovers [From.GetHerHis] mind or someone else is found to take [From.GetHerHis] place, the project will never finish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1408_prison;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s imprisonment has halted all construction of the new temple. The people are quickly scattering to the winds, returning to their homes...unless someone appears to take [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s place, all hope of it finishing will be lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1412;All construction on the new temple has halted, with [From.GetTitledFirstName] declaring it an impossible task. Unless someone appears soon to take [From.GetHerHis] place, the workers will have scattered to the winds and all hope of the project finishing will vanish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1413;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nWould that I had better news to give you. I fear the site where I hoped to erect the [Root.Religion.GetName] temple is no longer suitable. Unless somewhere else can be found, I fear I shall have to abandon my quest in disgrace.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1413;I have just the place in mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1414;With no-one to urge the locals to continue working, the temple construction in [Root.GetName] has been halted. Unless someone can be found to resume the task, it will have to be abandoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1414;Someone will be found to continue construction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1414;Sadly, there is nothing that can be done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1420;Pay for it myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1420;Ask my liege for help;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1421;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nConstruction efforts on the new [Root.Religion.GetName] temple have encountered unforeseen difficulties, and I fear I am completely without resources to continue. I beg you for coin, and I swear by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] it will be put to good use.\n\nYour humble servant,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1421;Of course I will help [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1421;I can offer [From.GetHerHim] nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1422;[From.Location.GetName] would be the perfect place to construct a new [Root.Religion.GetName] temple. All that remains is inspiring a pious and ambitious enough courtier to lead the construction and become its servant of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] once the temple is completed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1422;I choose [first_temple_choice.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1422;I choose [second_temple_choice.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1422;I choose [third_temple_choice.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1422;Perhaps not, then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1426;Good news! [From.GetFirstName] has completed work on the new [From.Religion.GetName] temple, assuming [From.GetHerHis] place as its [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]. All of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] rejoices, and a week of celebration has been called for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1430;New City Construction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1430;It has taken years, but finally you have located a suitable site in [Root.Location.GetName] which is both defensible as well as suitable for merchants and tribal leaders alike to gather in a city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1430;I should tell [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1431;Your [Root.GetTreasurerName], [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], has discovered a site in [new_city_location.GetName] suitable for building a new city, a place which both merchants and [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] leaders believe could support a large number of your people. It will, however, require a fair investment of both time and effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1431;My coffers will fund this project;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1431;Everyone in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] will participate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1431;We cannot afford such an indulgence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1433;The war raging in [Root.GetName] has ruined the construction that was underway for the new city. The effort will need to be restarted from scratch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1434;There is an issue with the city construction currently underway in [Root.GetName]: a fire destroyed a number of buildings after an accident, and there is a rumor amongst the workers that the site is haunted. It will take considerable convincing to get work to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1434;Additional coin will convince them, I'm certain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1434;They will continue because the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] tell them to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1434;Then we must abandon the project;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1435;It seems several of your overseers have pushed the workers too far. There have been several riots in [Root.GetName], and while construction has not been delayed yet it certainly may come to that if the riots spread further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1435;We will need to keep an eye on things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1436_tribal;A dispute has arisen with merchants in [Root.GetName], many of whom are unaccustomed to the idea of setting up in buildings as we are asking them to. They prefer their traditional methods, they say. Unless we get the merchants on board with the new city, it will never be completed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1436_feudal;A dispute has arisen with merchants in [Root.GetName], many of whom are complaining about inadequate conditions and the difficulty of dealing with local tribesmen who seem to have little idea regarding the importance of such a project. Unless we get the merchants on board with the new city, it will never be completed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1436;I will negotiate with these merchants myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1436;Send [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to negotiate with them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1436;Round up a few and execute them, to show them their place;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1436;They are holding out for more coin, I suspect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_1436;We have no choice but to abandon the project;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1437;After years of effort, the new city in [Root.GetName] is finally complete!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus.1454;This decision allows you to play a completely different game. By proceeding you will be able to generate a completely random world with the option of ancient religions, or standard religions. You will even be able to decide if everyone starts as a count, duke or king. Please keep in mind that if this is a multiplayer game only the host should do these options.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus.1454;Sounds intriguing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus.1454;What nonsense;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus.1455;Would you like to use standard religions, or ancient religions (such as Kemetic, Celtic etc)?\nThe game will appear to be frozen and non-responsive after picking this choice, this is normal and you must simply wait.

EVTOPTB_Plus.1455;Ancient Religions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus.1455;Nevermind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_1500_A;My spies believe they have collected enough information on [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]'s comings and goings that my plot should now have a better chance of success, and indeed should happen more quickly than originally planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1500_B;My spies believe they have collected enough information on [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]'s comings and goings that the plot against [target_spy_on.GetHerHim] should now have a much better chance of success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1501;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nMy people have been watching [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] for some time now, and we've acquired enough knowledge of [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] comings and going to help your plot against [target_spy_on.GetHerHim]. With luck, my information will see us to success.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1505;An interesting bit of information has surfaced from my spying on [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]: the man everyone believes to be [[target_spy_on.GetHerHis] father is not. [target_spy_on.GetHerHisCap] mother, [target_spy_on.Mother.GetTitledFirstName] once had a torried affair with [target_spy_on.RealFather.GetTitledName], and it is he who is [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]'s real father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_Plus_1505;Reveal the truth for all to see;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1505;I have no interest in this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1506;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nIt has come to my attention that you are, in truth, the father of [target_spy_on.GetTitledName]. No, there is no need to deny it.

If you do not make it worth my time to keep them to myself, it will be most unfortunate.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1507;It seems you leave me no choice. To protect both my own reputation and that of [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName], It seems I must do as you demand.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1508;You believe I am concerned that anyone might know of [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstName]'s true lineage? I have borne scandal before. Do your worst, fiend, you shall see no profit in this deed.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1508;Then it seems everyone must know the truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1508;Bah! Fair enough, I'll not go through with it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1509;News has been circulating throughout court that [Root.Father.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is not, in fact, your father. They say [target_true_father.GetTitledName] is, and, true or not, it seems everyone believes the scandal. You have been declared a bastard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1509;How can this be??;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1510;News has been circulating throughout court that [target_spy_on.Father.GetTitledName] is not, in fact, the father of [target_spy_on.GetTitledName]. [target_true_father.GetTitledName] is, having once had a torried affair with [target_spy_on.Mother.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], the child kept a secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1510;Such a scandal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1515;My spies have uncovered some interesting information on [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]: [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] was recently seen in the company of [target_revealed_lover.GetTitledName], and I'm assured the two of them are clearly lovers and have been for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_1516;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI am aware of your affair with [target_revealed_lover.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal].

EVTDESC_Plus_1517;What you believe you know is barely worth clarifying. Here is coin enough to keep your silence, wretch, for I have not the time to deal with the scandal your wagging tongue would cause.\n\nTake it and go,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_Plus_1519;Reveal [From.GetHerHis] affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1519;Let the matter drop;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1525;Your spies have recently overheard [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] saying some rather unflattering things about [target_new_rival.GetTitledName]. Considering that [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] also has no love for [target_spy_on.GetHerHim], it might be possible to enflame a rivalry between the two without anyone being the wiser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1525;Make the attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1525;No, I don't want to risk it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1526;Success! A few rumors spread in the courts of both [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] have resulted in their mutual dislike blossoming into a new rivalry. Now all that remains is to see where this leads...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1527;You've never cared for [target_new_rival.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is constantly filled with rumors of the terrible things [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] has been saying about you. It is beyond the pale, and enough is enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1527;How dare [target_new_rival.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1528;You've never cared for [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is constantly filled with rumors of the terrible things [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] has been saying about you. It is beyond the pale, and enough is enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1528;How dare [target_spy_on.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1529;While you've filled the courts of both [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] with rumors, neither of them seems to have taken the bait. At best, they are irritated with each other. Thankfully, neither has clued into the fact that the rumors have come from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1530;You've never cared for [target_new_rival.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is filled with constant rumors regarding how much [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] dislikes you. Even so, you find it hard to credit this talk as more than just talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1530;I so despise court gossip;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1531;You've never cared for [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is filled with constant rumors regarding how much [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] dislikes you. Even so, you find it hard to credit this talk as more than just talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1532;Alas, while you've filled the courts of both [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] with rumors, neither appears to have taken the bait. Worse, their suspicions that someone is behind these rumors has been raised. Your hand may have been revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1533;You've never cared for [target_new_rival.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is constantly filled with rumors of the terrible things [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] has been saying about you. It turns out, however, that the rumors are false and come from [From.GetTitledName], who has been attempting to stir a rivalry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1533;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1534;You've never cared for [target_spy_on.GetTitledName] overly much, nor [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] for you, but lately your court is constantly filled with rumors of the terrible things [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] has been saying about you. It turns out, however, that the rumors are false and come from [From.GetTitledName], who has been attempting to stir a rivalry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1540;Your spies report that [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is not on good terms with [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] liege, [target_new_rival.GetTitledName]. Indeed, it might be possible to plant rumors and sour relations between them even further...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1541;Success! Rumors planted in the courts of both [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] have stirred up animosity between them both, with neither aware that you are the one responsible. Now it only remains to see what comes of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1542;While you have no great love for your liege, recently you've heard far too many rumors regarding how much [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] dislikes you. You were disinclined to believe them, but the way [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] glared at you at your last meeting has persuaded you otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1542;So that's how it is, is it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1543;While you have no great love for [target_spy_on.GetTitledName], you had no idea that [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] despised you so much until you began hearing rumors of [target_spy_on.GetHerHis] hateful comments. When you last saw [target_spy_on.GetHerHim] at court, the glares [target_spy_on.GetSheHe] shot your way confirmed your suspicions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1544;While you planted rumors in [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court regarding [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], they have been lost amidst all the hubbub of [target_new_rival.GetHerHis] daily duties and thus were ignored. Thankfully, neither [target_new_rival.GetSheHe] nor [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] are aware of your attempt to cause trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1545;Alas, while you planted rumors in [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court regarding [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], they have been mostly ignored...and, far worse, you believe they have begun to suspect your involvement in starting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1546;There have been far too many rumors lately regarding [target_new_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s supposed dislike of you...enough so that you were prompted to investigate, only to discover rumors that you hated [target_new_rival.GetHerHim] as well! The rumors were spread by [From.GetTitledName], who is evidently attempting to cause trouble between you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1546;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1547;There have been far too many rumors lately regarding [target_spy_on.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s supposed dislike of you...enough so that you were prompted to investigate, only to discover rumors that you hated [target_spy_on.GetHerHim] as well! The rumors were spread by [From.GetTitledName], who is evidently attempting to cause trouble between you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1550;Through constant prayer and dedication to virtue, all the stress you feel has started to...simply melt away. Perhaps this is the peace a simpler life entails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1550;I shall renew my dedication to God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1551;It has taken time, but your devotion to prayer and virtue has lifted the dark clouds from your thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1552;You have come to realize that your devotion to drink is, in itself, a form of gluttony that simply cannot be abided. The time for abstinence has come, as difficult as it will be on your system after so many years of excess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1553;You have devoted yourself for so long to your pursuit of saintly virtue, sometimes it feels as if you make almost no progress at all. But you are getting there, slow as the path might be. You can feel yourself drawing closer to God with each passing day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1553;God forgive me my impatience;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1554;It seems as if you have been walking the path to saintly virtue forever. Can it really be achieved, or is it all some lie peddled by the priests to the gullible? Doubt besets you, and you feel your resolve slipping despite your continued dedication to prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1554;I will not give up! I must not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1555_fail1;It is too much. Setback after setback has beset you, and it seems more and more unlikely you will ever achieve saintly virtue as you desire. It pains you to admit, but the time has come to give up on your ambition -- you are simply not the [Root.GetManWoman] of God you'd hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1555_fail2;You have literally spent years on the path to saintly virtue, but you admit to yourself there are still flaws in your character that cannot be ignored. You are a sinner in your heart, and that baser part of you cannot be banished no matter how much you try. Sadly, the time has come to give up your ambition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1555;I simply cannot do it any longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1556;You have spent years upon the path to saintly virtue, years spent banishing your inner demons and focusing exclusively on prayer and devotion to duty. The time has finally come to realize you have achieved your goal -- you are considered far and wide to be a [Root.GetManWoman] of God and a paragon of Christian piety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1556;I am but a servant of God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1601;My liege,\nNaturally it is in all our best interests to ensure there is a smooth transition between your rule and that of [liege_heir.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], much as we would all prefer to believe you will never die. When the inevitable comes to pass, of course I will give [liege_heir.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] what support I can.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1602;My liege,\nYour rule is a benevolent one, and while I would prefer to believe you will never die, I know that cannot be.

EVTDESC_Plus_1614;Good news! [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has not only managed to retain [Root.GetHerHis] throne, [Root.GetSheHe] has done it in a convincing manner with the support of the majority of [Root.GetHerHis] vassals.

EVTDESC_Plus_1615;After much debate, the lords of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have decided that [succession_winner.GetTitledName] would be better suited than [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to assume the throne. The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] succession has been overturned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1616;After much debate, the lords of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] were unable to come to definitive agreement regarding the succession. Since no single candidate gained enough votes, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will retain the throne...though many fear this will almost certainly lead to civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1617;While the lords of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] had planned to gather in [Root.Capital.GetName], believing [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to be unsuited for the throne, the war has sidetracked their efforts and it is unlikely they will maintain their momentum.

EVTDESC_Plus_1907;After the unjust murder of his son by local authorities, a follower of the Kharijite sect of Islam by the name of Musawir ibn 'Abd al-Hamid al-Shari has launched an insurrection in the province of Mosul, aiming to toppling the rule of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].

EVTDESC_Plus_2013;The growing power of the Cathar Church has led it to organize itself as a reflection of the Catholic Church. Created through the political will of [From.GetTitledName], this new Church has a leader: [new_cathar_pope.GetTitledName], elected at a special gathering of bishops in [From.Capital.GetName]. The Cathar world rejoices at the news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2013;Is this their idea of a Pope?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2013;And so the Christian world devours itself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2013;Glory to Jesus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2015;John Wycliff;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2015;A discredited seminary student by the name of John Wycliff has been spending his time in [new_lollard_stronghold.GetName], preaching his heretical thoughts on the Bible to the peasants--specifically that the Catholic Church must be reformed. He speaks out against the greed and excess of Catholic priests, the Sacrament of the Eucharist, and the over-emphasis of reverence paid to Christian idols. Many peasants, having no love for the corrupt priests of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], have embraced his teachings and the Lollard heresy is spreading like wildfire throughout the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2015;Where is my Archbishop?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2015;Terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2015;A wise man indeed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2015;Let the heathens fight each other;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2016;As you men storm the church, they discover a rich cache of icons and relics, all of it gilded in gold and surely belonging to [From.Owner.GetTitledName]. Such greed and devotion to icons goes against everything the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith stands for...but this is still a holy place, is it not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2016;Destroy them, and take the gold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2016;I will not desecrate such beauty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2017;Translation of the Bible;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2017;Several years ago, [Root.GetTitledName] ordered a translation of the Bible into the vernacular. The [Root.Religion.GetName]s believe, after all, that one of the way the Catholic Church maintains control over the masses is by restricting those who can read it to those educated few versed in the ancient tongue of Latin. A non-Latin Bible is, then, something of a revelation. Fortunately, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s Bible is considered to be a fine translation: clear, easy to read, and already quite popular with the common man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2017;Glory to God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2017;This is an affront to God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2018;Several years ago, [Root.GetTitledName] ordered a translation of the Bible into the vernacular. The [Root.Religion.GetName]s believe, after all, that one of the way the Catholic Church maintains control over the masses is by restricting those who can read it to those educated few versed in the ancient tongue of Latin. A non-Latin Bible is, then, something of a revelation. Unfortunately for [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [Root.GetHerHis] new Bible is not only considered something of a poor translation -- with far too many parts obviously swayed by the politics of the day -- it is mostly mocked outside of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and mostly disregarded. Even so, it is of great interest to many, and has aided the spread of the [Root.Religion.GetName]s faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2018;We will keep working on it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2020;The death of [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] means that [From.GetHerHis] efforts to translate the Bible into the vernacular have been put on hold. Not only that, they are in disarray, and it will take a fair amount of effort to continue the task. Alternatively, the plan could be stopped now, and at least some of the expense regained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2020;I will continue [From.GetHerHis] efforts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2020;[From.GetHerHisCap] dream dies with [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2021_not_lollard;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nYou are a holy [Root.GetManWoman], it is true...but you are also not a believer in the ideals we Lollards uphold. You revel in excess and greed, and thus I cannot allow you to retain your titles in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. They are to be revoked at once, and given to a more worthy member of the clergy.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2021_wicked;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nI understand you espouse the Lollard ideals...yet I see no evidence of that in your conduct. You make a mockery of all we believe, and thus I cannot allow you to retain your titles in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. They are to be revoked at once, and given to a more worthy member of the clergy.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2021_high_tier;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nSince you are a priest who understands the tenets of the Lollard faith, you will see why I have come to the belief that you have gained far too many titles for your station. A good [Root.GetManWoman] of the Lord should attend to more simple matters. Thus I hereby declare that your greater titles be claimed by the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2021;So be it -- there is nothing to be done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2021;No! I will fight [From.GetHerHim], if I must!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2022;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nIf that is what you have decided, then so must it be. My titles are yours.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2023;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nIf you truly feel that my greater titles are not suitable for a Christian priest, there is nothing I can do to stop your claim.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2024;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI will not bow down to the petty demands of a [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetManWoman] such as yourself, not now and not ever!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2024;[From.GetSheHeCap] will regret that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2025;Brother Angelo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2025;A disgruntled Catholic monk by the name of Brother Angelo has heavily criticized [Root.GetTitledName], and in so doing has rocked the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. Brother Angelo denies that [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is legally the pope, as [Root.GetSheHe] has abrogated the Rule of St. Francis -- which, according to his doctrine, represented the pure and simple Gospel. He has asserted that all of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s decrees are thus invalid, and that all Catholics who follow the Pope's will have lost the grace of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2025;The man is clearly a heretic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2025;He sounds like a man with the right ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2025;Criticize the Pope? Unheard of!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2027;The words of Brother Angelo have been weighing on your soul. Too many churchmen are more concerned more with power and money than with their holy calling, and the result is a Catholic Church that is rife with corruption. Perhaps the Fraticelli are right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2027;I believe in their call for reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2027;Right or not, I will follow the Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_Plus_2030;The Poor of Lyons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2030;A wealthy merchant of Lyons by the name of Pierre Valdes gave up all his earthly possessions and began wandering the countryside as a preacher after a brush with death. He has been condemning the Catholic Church for its corruption, as well as calling for a return to a more Biblical lifestyle. The man has rapidly gained followers amongst the poor of Lyons, and his disciples have ranged even further and begun seeking converts in northern Italy -- enough to cause considerable concern within the Catholic hierarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2030;The man is clearly a heretic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2030;And thus another heresy begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2030;Another problem for the Catholics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2031;The founding of the Waldensian Church was mostly underground, and the so the early initiates organized themselves into cells. The Doctores would lead the cells and train Novellani, who would go and preach to the masses, while the Sandaliati would travel to keep the cells in touch. It is a tradition that has continued to this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2031;I am Sandaliati;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2031;I am Doctores;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2031;I am Novellani;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2032;As a Waldensian [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], you are considered to have brought considerable renown to the cause. What some might have disregarded as a passing thing is now given far more serious weight in the world, perhaps even enough to one day challenge the gravitas of the Pope himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2032;Lux Lucit in Tenebris!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2034;As your men storm the church, you cut down a [From.Owner.Religion.GetName] priest trying to protect a relic, gilded in gold. These false idols are a means to deceive the peasants and confuse ignorant fools. You are of half a mind to destroy them and return the wealth to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2034;Do it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2034;I would rather keep it for myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2035_rome;Rome, the Eternal City, and the source of all the corruption of the Church. It is full of treasures stolen from the people, false relics to deceive the gullible. Your men have their orders: destroy them all, and return the wealth to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2035_canterbury;Canterbury, where the tomb Thomas Beckett lies...or lied, since it is there no longer. The tomb has been destroyed by your holy wrath, no longer able to tempt poor Christian fools away from devoting their faith to false relics, and the wealth of its riches returned to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2035_santiago;You don't know who is buried in this shrine, but you know it is not St. James. That is just a false legend made to trick pilgrims and take their money. Well, no longer. You give the bones a proper burial, and then burn the shrine down around you. The wealth of its relics have been returned to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2035_koln;In the Cathedral of Köln, there lies the Sarcophagus of the Magi: over two meters of gilded silver and jewels. Why waste such wealth on falsehoods, idols that lure the foolish away from their true faith in God, when it could be given to the poor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2035;So must it be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2036;The Sacking of [FromFrom.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2036_rome;After the Waldensians seized Rome, they proceeded to destroy any and all holy relics they could reach, stripping all the wealth from the Roman churches. The bones of St. Peter have been thrown out and cast into the street, the Chains of St. Paul melted down, and the Scala Santa smashed and destroyed. Catholics everywhere are distraught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2036_canterbury;Canterbury, the great pilgrimage site for all of the British Isles has been destroyed, the tomb of St. Thomas Beckett desecrated by the Waldensians. Even as the heretics rejoice at their victory, so are Catholics elsewhere distraught at the loss of the holy relics now cast aside as worthless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2036_santiago;The Way of St. James has no endpoint now, as Santiago de Compostela has fallen to the Waldensians. The shrine of St. James has been destroyed, the bones once therein now missing, and the many holy relics which belonged to the shrine have either been destroyed or cast to the people as trinkets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2036_koln;The Grand Cathedral of Köln now smoulders as the Waldensians strip it of everything of value. Countless relics have been destroyed, including the Sarcophagus of the Magi: over two meters of gilded silver and jewels, all melted down. The Waldensians say that the poor shall be able to eat for a year on what was stored there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2036;Sacrilege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2036;A victory for sense and righteousness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2037;All Waldensian lords are expect to give charity to the poor and disenfranchised in their realm. Now, that tenet is tested as a large number of refugees have arrived into [Root.Capital.GetName] from the provinces of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. The war has left them destitute, and their numbers have overwhelmed the ability of the city to support them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2037;They must be helped;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2037;There is nothing to be done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2038;In the sermon today, your priest expounded on the sin of greed, and how no greedy [Root.GetManWoman] can enter heaven. You just wish he didn't use yourself as an example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2038;He's not wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2039;A recent opportunity to improve the facilities in [Root.Capital.GetName] for assisting the poor has arisen, and it is something your councillors tell you will not only assist the people but make the city far better than it has ever been. It does, however, require a significant investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2039;Then we must do it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2039;We cannot afford it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2040;The ideals of the Waldensian faith have made a big impression on you. You have decided to be charitable at all times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2040;The poor need our help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2041;Messalians believe everyone is born with demons inside them, and those demons can only be expelled by intercession of the Holy Spirit...which can only be summoned with intense asceticism and prayer. It may take years to finally succeed, but you are ready to begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2041;Let the demons be driven out, once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2042;You have prayed and fasted for months on end, but despite all your efforts you are still haunted by the sins of the flesh. You are forced to give up in defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2042_lunacy;You have prayed and fasted for months on end, but in the end you are forced to admit your mind is still not your own. If anything, the spells of lunacy have become worse as weakness and dizziness beset you, and there are nights were you wander through the castle, howling. The demons are too strong, and you are forced to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2042_possession;You have prayed and fasted for months on end, but in the end you are forced to admit your mind is still not your own. In fact, the visions come more frequently, now. Lucifer himself has been speaking with you, whispering of your lamentable weakness...and you have to admit you agree. The demons within you are simply too strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2042;I will try again, I swear it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2043_lust;It has taken many, many months of prayer and cold baths, but you have finally succeeded in driving the daemon of Luxuria from your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_2043_possession;You almost thought this day would never come. After many, many months of prayer and meditation, you wake up one morning and...the voices in your head are simply gone. You cannot even remember a time when you felt so in control of yourself. The demon in your mind has finally been driven out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2043_lunacy;You almost thought this day would never come. After many, many months of prayer and meditation, you wake up one morning and...your mind is simply your own. No more irrational impulses, no more dangerous thoughts. It is as if they simply never were. You cannot even remember a time when you felt so in control of yourself. The demon in your mind has finally been driven out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2043;Finally, I am free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2044_not_messalian;Since you are no longer Messalian, there is no point in continuing the prayer and fasting. There are no demons within you to cast out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2044_prisoner;While you would happily continue your ritual prayer and fasting, it is simply not possible to do so while you are imprisoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2044_incapable;While you would happily continue your ritual prayer and fasting, such rigorousness is now simply beyond your capacity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2046;Despite your prayers, you are still haunted by lustful dreams at night. The craving for carnal pleasures feels as if it will overwhelm you at times. The demon within may be too strong for you to expel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_Plus_2047;I must resist temptation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2047;I have no choice but to give in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_Plus_2048;I cannot surrender to the sins of the flesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2049;The sound of rattling dice draws you toward a pair of guardsmen, gambling for silver. It just so happens you have a set of loaded dice in your pocket, given to you from a friend in jest. Should you teach these fools a lesson?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2049;No, gambling is sinful and greedy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2049;Perhaps just a few games won't hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2050;You haven't been keeping up on your prayers to expel the daemon of Sloth, which, beyond the irony of the situation, has been troubling you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2050;I will make a determined effort;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2050;The prayers can wait until tomorrow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_Plus_2051;Slowly count to ten...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2051;Have that hat nailed to his head;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2052;Your attempts to pray your envy away have been difficult.

EVTOPTA_Plus_2052;I can do without another horse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2052;It is rightfully mine, anyhow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2053;Your prayers to end your pride have not been successful. However, a young member of your church has proven himself skilled at exorcisms. Do you own up and ask for his assistance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2053;Humbly ask him for help;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2053;No, that's ridiculous! What could he do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2054;A criminal is brought before you for justice, having been caught stealing a small breakfast roll from the market.

EVTOPTB_Plus_2054;Hang him as he deserves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_Plus_2057;The Army of Lucifer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2057;The growing power of the Messalians can no longer be denied. With the aid of [Root.GetTitledName], a group of fanatics, peasants, and madmen have now banded together to create their own army -- one that has, much to the shock of Christians elsewhere in the world, taken as its patron saint none other than Lucifer the Lighbringer, greatest of the Archangels and the King of Hell. Lucifer, they believe, is no more than an agent of chaos and change, and in His name they intend to bring about a change in the world. They will drive the demons of sin from the ranks of humanity with the force of their arms...if they are given the chance, that is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_2100;Above the gate to a city in [acheiropoieta_province.GetName], there is enshrined an Acheiropoieta: an icon which, it is claimed, was not created by human hands but rather came into existence miraculously. All icons in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are condemned to be destroyed, but the people of [acheiropoieta_province.GetName] have refused to destroy the Acheiropoieta, claiming its divine heritage shelters the city from danger. [iconoclast_patriarch.GetTitledName] has, however, demanded you deal it regardless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Now, a group of soldiers has reportedly broken into the imperial mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Apostles, opened the sarcophagus of Constantine V, and implored him to return and save the empire. Iconoclast zealots have been quick to jump on this news, claiming it is Orthodox idolatry that is dooming the emperor.

EVTDESC_Plus_2105;While the Paulician faith has been riven by internal conflicts for the last few decades, the heresy has a new leader in [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], a zealous priest of [Root.Culture.GetName] origin as well as an effective converter. He has spread his sect throughout Armenian lands ruled by the Byzantine Empire, and is very quickly becoming a major problem for Orthodox rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2105;Blasted heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2106;All across the Byzantine Empire, Paulicians are being violently persecuted on the order of [Root.GetTitledName]. They are rounded up and imprisoned, their homes burned and their belongings seized. All Paulician courtiers have been ordered either executed or banished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2106;Hopefully that will take care of it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2106;A rather extreme measure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2106;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2107;The Paulician Patriarch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2107;[Root.GetTitledName] has claimed the title of Paulician Patriarch, head of all Christians who follow the teachings of Paul of Samosata. Others outside of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] claim the [Root.GetManWoman] is little more than a glorified warlord, but to the Paulician faithful [Root.GetSheHe] is a symbol of their victory against attempts by their fellow Christians to suppress them. Perhaps, in time, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will lead the Paulicians to claiming a piece of history in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2107;A glorious day for us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2107;Who is this upstart heretic?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_Plus_2110;Bogomilists in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2110;A heresiarch by the name of 'Bogomil', which may not even be his true name, has appeared in the province of Kossovo, capitalizing on the anger of the locals following their conversion from pagan ways. His teachings of a heresy that seems to combine Christianity with a combination of Gnostic dualism and anti-church sentiment has caught on extremely quickly in both Kossovo and the surrounding areas, presenting a challenge to [Root.GetTitledName]'s rule as well as to the authority of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Some believe that this 'Bogomil' has reached the court of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], and that [Root.GetSheHe] might even be considered a conversion to these heretical beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2110;I believe this priest has wise things to say;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2110;Me, convert? To a foul heresy?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2110;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2110;This does not bode well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2112;The formalization process of Bogomilism has officially begun, with [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] meeting with a group of perfecti leaders in [Root.Capital.GetName] and expressing [Root.GetHerHis] desire to see the faith go from a disorganized movement to one fully integrated with [Root.GetHerHis] rule. They expressed doubt, but were willing to hear [Root.GetHerHim] out, for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2112;We will all have to be patient;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2113_religion;All this talk of 'reforming' the Bogomilist faith in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is pointless. Perhaps the previous rulers were interested in such a thing, but since you are not a Bogomilist, you will certainly have no part in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2113_rule;While you would gladly continue the process of reforming the Bogomilist faith, you no longer have the influence to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2114;[Root.GetTitledName]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have been rewarded after a recent meeting of Perfecti in [Root.Capital.GetName]. They finally agreed to a common liturgy, so that ceremonies performed across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] use a common set of prayers and rituals, and that this will be taught to new Perfecti going forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2115;Up until now, Bogomilist priests have all used different letters and gospels in their preaching, a result of the scattered and disparate beginnings of the faith. At the behest of [Root.GetTitledName], the '[Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] Bible' has been written and agred upon as canon by a council of Perfecti in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2116;In order to continue the process of formalizing the Bogomilist faith, the scattered preachers and Perfecti will need to be gathered together in councils. They resist such efforts an organization, however, and the only way to see it done will be with coin -- for the poor, for shrines, for bribes, and for God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2116;If that is what it takes, so be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2116;I will not bribe my faith into reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2117;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have been rewarded after an unprecedented agreement from Bogomilist leaders across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to gather in permanent councils sponsored by the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2117;A good day for all Bogomilists;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2118;A Bogomilist Perfecti has approached you with an idea for continuing your efforts to formalize your faith: the construction of several seminary schools across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], each teaching a common and unified version of Bogomilism dogma to future preachers. It would be expensive, but the Perfecti says it would be a worthy achievement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2118;An excellent idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2118;Not right now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2119;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have advanced, with the construction of numerous seminary schools across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] that would each train new priests in a standardized form of dogma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2120;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have been rewarded today after a prominent Perfecti in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] issued a proclamation of support. The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] is a [Root.GetManWoman] of piety and faith, he says, and thus [Root.GetHerHis] desires should be heeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2121;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have advanced after the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] gave a speech in [Root.Capital.GetName] that has been widely-disseminated and complimented by pious scholars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2122;A recent treatise written by [Root.GetTitledName] [Root.GetHerHim]self on the vital importance of Bogomilism's continued reforms has spread far and wide across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and received a lot of recognition from the faithful as being full of wisdom. Indeed, some are viewing the text as a new addition to Bogomilist canon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2123;Recently, a new sect of Bogomilist has been spreading in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], one that advocates a radically different version of the faith. Normally this would not be an issue, as the sect is not popular, but it has proven disruptive to your efforts to formalize Bogomilism, as their presence has prompted other sects to follow suit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2123;Leave them be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2123;Quietly get rid of them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2124;A recent revival of Bogomilist traditionalism has taken hold in [PrimaryTitle.GetName], with numerous preachers cropping up who actively deride your efforts to reform the faith as being exactly the same sort of tyrannical structure they rebelled against in the first place. Needless to say, this has not been helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2125;A prominent Perfecti in [demand_province.GetName] has publicly begged that you slow down, if not outright stop, the process of Bogomilist reform. The common folk are confused by these contradictions, he says, and continuing down this path too quickly will only bring down God's wrath. The Perfecti is too popular to be silenced, as doing so would turn him into a martyr for his cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2125;Do as he asks, for now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2125;Ignore him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2126;A set of crop failures and other disasters that has fallen one of your provinces in recent months has stirred the ire of several fiery preaches in the area. They say that you are to blame, that your desire for reforms and general lack of piety is what has brought down God's wrath upon the people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Sadly, their words have taken hold amongst many.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2127;A prominent Perfecti has recently taken issue with your desire to reform the Bogomilist faith, pointing out a number of flaws in your argument without ever actually saying outright that your intention is solely to grab power and force the faithful into compliance. To her, you are not a learned enough [Root.GetManWoman] to push such things forward, and there is no convincing her otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2128;[Root.GetTitledName]'s recent victory against [From.GetTitledName] in [Root.Location.GetName] has been hailed as a major victory for Bogomilism, and has spread the notion that perhaps the continuing reforms of the faith have God's favor after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2129;[Root.GetTitledName]'s recent staggering loss against [From.GetTitledName] in [Root.Location.GetName] has been hailed as a sign that the ongoing reforms of the Bogomilist faith do not have God's favor after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2130;Bogomilist Faith Organized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2130;In its inception, the Bogomilist faith was only loosely organized. It didn't believe in formal churches, and opposed any kind of formal hierarchy -- this has all changed with the leadership of [Root.GetTitledName], whose piety and status as a Perfecti has encouraged all members of [Root.GetHerHis] faith to reconsider their resistance to feudal structures. Bogomilists across the world are now more formally organized, though many still do not consider them a true religion, and they remain opposed to any kind of formal church that emulates the Orthodox priesthood. Even so, there are many that object to even these changes, saying that Bogomilism has betrayed its own roots at a powerful [Root.GetLordLady]'s behest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2130;A better day for us all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2131;Bogomilist Faith Formalized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2131;Though the faithful were hardly ready for it, Bogomilism has now been formalized as a structured religion thanks to the leadership of [Root.GetTitledName]. While many see [Root.GetHerHis] leadership and piety as being worthwhile to follow, there are many who claim [Root.GetSheHe] has dragged the faith too fast into something which too much resembles the very kind of tyrannical structures they once abandoned. Preachers throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are questioning how far this will go, and whether the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] has not perhaps betrayed Bogomilism's principles for the sake of power. Whatever the case, Bogomilist priests are now unified under a common liturgy, a single sacred text, and operate out of temples -- far more than the disparate heretics from where they sprang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2131;This is how it must be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2131;Are we truly ready for this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2132;After a long and arduous process of reform, the Bogomilist faith can now truly be considered a formal religion. Under the considered leadership and piety of [Root.GetTitledName], Bogomilist priests are now unified under a common liturgy, a single sacred text, and operate out of temples -- far more than the disparate heretics from where they sprang. While some question whether these reforms betray the principles upon which Bogomilism was founded, far more say they were agreed to by all and with due consideration. The faith is now ready to come into its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_Plus_2134;The Bogomilist Patriarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2134;At the behest of [Root.GetTitledName], [new_bogomilist_patriarch.GetTitledName] has been elected as the head of the newly-founded Bogomilist Church, Bogomilism having completely transformed itself from an Orthodox heresy into a fully-formed religion in its own right. Christian leaders elsewhere have been forced to recognize this new faith as a force in its own right, and its inception as a schism from standard Christianity rather than a true heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2134;It appears we must accept this now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2134;Heretics or not, they are still Christians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2135;Construction has begun in Tyrnovo on the planned Church of St. Bogomil, a structure to rival St. Peter's Basilica or the Hagia Sophia. It will surely be a marvel of construction, and a bastion of faith for all Bogomilists across the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_Plus_2137;The Church of St. Bogomil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2137;As evidence of just how far the Bogomilist faith has come, the Church of St. Bogomil has completed construction in the city of Tyrnovo. A majestic structure to rival even the most potent Christian cathedrals, the church has become a bastion of faith for all Bogomilists across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Unlike previous councils, there is a feeling that the Great Schism may actually be resolved -- indeed, with the influence that [council_holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] holds amongst the faithful, it may very well be that the [target_religion.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] has no choice but to agree to the council's resolutions even if the result would turn [target_religion.GetHerHim] into a virtual heretic.

This is referred to as the Filioque, and by the decree of Pope [Root.GetFirstName] it has been added to the creed used by Latin bishops, to underline the importance of the Son in the Trinity...and reoundingly rejected by the vast majority of Greek bishops, who are furious that the Pope did so without calling an ecumenical council. To most, this is yet another example of the growing division between Greek and Latin Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2280;The Pope oversteps [Root.GetHerHis] bounds once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2280;Do they seriously reject the Son's true importance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2280;Surely some kind of compromise can be reached?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2281;Papal Jurisdiction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2281;A recent rare meeting between [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [current_patriarch.GetTitledFirstName] in Constantinople to discuss the ecclesiastical jurisdiction over [jurisdiction_realm.PrimaryTitle.GetName] was said to end in near-chaos, with [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] storming out of the cathedral in a fury. The Pope claims that [jurisdiction_realm.PrimaryTitle.GetName] falls within [Root.GetHerHis] rightful domain, while [current_patriarch.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] claims [jurisdiction_realm.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has never been part of either ecclesiastical realm, and that this is yet another example of the Pope striving to assert primacy where it is not warranted. This latest conflict over papal jurisdiction has left both patriarchs almost unwilling to communicate at all, a fact which has left many of their bishops extremely worried.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2281;[jurisdiction_realm.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is its own domain, clearly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2281;So [jurisdiction_realm.PrimaryTitle.GetName] should be left without a proper Patriarch?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2281;This bickering does no-one any good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2282;Conflict Over the Eucharist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2282_greek;A dispute between [Root.GetTitledName] and a number of [Root.GetHerHis] Latin priests has quickly spread to the highest reaches of Christian rule. [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [Root.GetHerHim]self a follower of the Greek rites, took to task a number of priests in [Root.GetHerHis] realm who were using unleavened bread while administering the Eucharist, calling them 'azymites' and ultimately ordering their arrest. The priests complained, outraged, and their anger spread to other Latin realms, resulting in a series of sweeping edicts against several Greek practices. Greek bishops have responded in kind, and while leaders have allowed the matter to blow over, the simmering anger between both sides remains sharp and clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_Plus_2283;The Wicked [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2283;The depredations of [Root.GetTitledName] are renowned throughout the Christian world, [Root.GetHerHis] wickedness having reached such infamy that [other_patriarch.GetTitledFirstName] has called for [Root.GetHerHis] removal from holy office. [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is said to have laughed at this, shocking [Root.GetHerHis] advisors by launching into a tirade over the [other_patriarch.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] within earshot of the [other_patriarch.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s envoys. The resulting chill between the Greek and Latin leaders has deepened the already-wide division in Christianity, once again raising the specter of a possible schism within the faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2283;What was the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] thinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2284;Call For Council Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2284;Perhaps fearing the ever-growing rift between the Latin and Greek branches of Christianity, [Root.GetTitledName] issued a call for reconciliation with a new Ecumenical Council in [Root.Capital.GetName]...a call that has been met by [current_patriarch.GetTitledName] with little more than stony silence. For many, this was seen as a last chance to avert what they see as the coming schism. Now all such hope has been quenched, and it is thought to be only a matter of time before the division becomes official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2284;'Reconciliation', [Root.GetSheHe] calls it? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2284;If it happens, it is on the Ecumenical Patriarch's head;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2284;I suppose we shall have to wait and see;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2284;Has it truly become so bad between them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2286;The Great Schism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2286;The inevitable has finally occurred: a delivery of a bull of excommunication to [current_patriarch.GetTitledName] by [schism_pope.GetTitledName] has been responded to in kind. The mutual excommunication follows on the heels of what is reported to be a series of terse letters over Christian doctrine, each building on the growing divisions between Latin and Greek Christianity. While few are treating the event as noteworthy at the moment, the reality of the situation is that Rome and Constantinople have grown apart to the point where any hope of reconciliation has been completely lost. They have, in truth, become two separate faiths operating under their separate religious heads, despite the Pope's and the Ecumenical Patriarch's assurances to the contrary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2286;We follow the Bishop of Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2286;We follow the Ecumenical Patriarch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2286;This is of great concern...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_Plus_2351;The Journey of Nerthus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2351;With [nerthus_top_liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in a time of peace, [Root.GetTitledName] has declared that the time has come for the Journey of Nerthus. The fertility goddess will travel across the land in a covered chariot, with only [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] permitted to look upon her, her arrival in each hold calling for a time of feasting and celebration. It is one of the most holy of Germanic traditions, a period during which lords are not permitted to engage in war, at least until the goddess tires of her travels and retires to the sacred grove again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2351;We will celebrate with a great feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2351;Excellent, I was already planning a feast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2351;The celebrations will be kept to a minimum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_2352;With the feasts throughout [nerthus_top_liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] now done, and the holy cart having completed its circuit throughout the land, the goddess Nerthus has apparently tired of her communications with mortal men and returned to the sacred grove in Castum.

EVTOPTB_Plus_2352;It's over? What a relief;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_2354;The Journey of Nerthus has begun, and you hear many tales of fertility rites her priests can perform. Considering you are childless, perhaps it is worth seeking out the goddess's blessing upon your womb, dangerous as you hear those rites can be...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_2620;After a thorough questioning, [doubting_priest.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is clearly convinced of your piety and that your quest for sainthood is genuine. [doubting_priest.GetSheHeCap] begs your forgiveness, and suggests [doubting_priest.GetSheHe] will do whatever [doubting_priest.GetSheHe] can to help you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2621;After a thorough questioning, [doubting_priest.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] declares that you are no paragon of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and certainly no living saint. You are almost certain [doubting_priest.GetSheHe] had decided the outcome long before meeting you, and nothing you said could have persuaded [doubting_priest.GetHerHim] otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2621;Which of us truly lacks faith, I wonder?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2622;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your extreme piety and dedication to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Your name is constantly on the lips of the priests during their sermons, as they hold you up as an example to others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2623;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your dedication to knowledge and learning. You are a true [Root.Religion.GetName] scholar, they say, and the priests hold you up as an example to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2624;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your charisma and dedication to diplomacy. God has bestowed upon you a light that others admire, they say, and the priests hold you up as an example to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2625;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your martial prowess against the infidels. You are a true [Root.Religion.GetName] warrior, they say, and the priests hold you up as an example to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2626;Your base lusts run contrary to everything a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should possess, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer them. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2626;I shall make the attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2626;No, this isn't worth it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2627;Your gluttunous nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2628;Your greedy nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2629;Your slothful nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2630;Your envious nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2631;Your cruel nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2632;Your wrathful nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2633;Pride is the deadliest sin, as it is the source of all others. If you truly aspire to be a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, you will need to conquer this belief that you deserve more than others. You must prostrate yourself before God and take what judgement He decrees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2634;Your deceitful nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2635;You will never truly be a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith until you conquer your ambition. It comes from a sense of pride, at seeking to raise yourself above others rather than to accept what God has given you. To forget one's ambitions, however, is not an easy task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2636;Your arbitrary sense of justice runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_lustful;For weeks you have tried to forget your lusts, to focus on chasteful thoughts and nothing else...but it has been no use. Not thinking such things leads to thinking of little else, until you are nearly mad from the attempt. You are cursed, and it seems nothing you do will change it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_gluttonous;For weeks you have nearly starved yourself, attempting to force yourself to be temperate as a good [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GetManWoman] ought to be...but it is no use. After a late-night binge in the kitchens, you have to admit that your will has been defeated by your appetite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_greedy;For weeks you have been trying to be charitable, giving coins away to those in need and considering what possessions you ought to offer as gifts. Each time, however, thoughts of what you have lost dominate your mind until it nearly drives you mad. The last time a beggar asked for alms you kicked him. Sadly, it is no use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_slothful;For weeks you have tried to be diligent, forcing yourself to attend to every important duty no matter how minor. It has done nothing but make you irritable, and you slowly find yourself making every excuse to do anything else. All you want to do now is sleep, and forget you ever wanted to be saintly. It's so much work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_envious;For weeks you have tried to be kind, forcing yourself to think well of others and not envy the things they have which you do not. It is all just a facade, however. The spite built up inside until you lashed out at everyone who crossed your path, and now you just feel awful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_cruel;For weeks you have tried to be gentle and kind to everyone who crossed your path. Your edicts have been merciful, your sentences have been brief...but it's no use. It's as if not thinking cruel thoughts has made them ALL you can focus on. You need some time in the dungeons before you truly go mad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_wroth;For weeks you have tried to control your temper. You have been patient with everyone, so patient that your courtiers frequently marvel at this change of heart. But you despise them for admiring what you know are false words. After beating a page near to death for spilling your wine, you have to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_proud;For weeks you have tried to show humility. You have complimented those who didn't truly deserve it, gave others an opportunity to act even when you knew better, tried not to be angry when things didn't go your way...but it's no use. You don't feel any different. Indeed, perhaps you're not sure *how* not to be proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_deceitful;For weeks you have tried to be scrupulously honest, even regarding things that one really shouldn't be honest about. You heart isn't truly in it, however, and sometimes you find yourself winding your way around the truth like a snake. It's time to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_ambitious;For weeks you have done nothing...almost literally. You've made no plans, made no attempts to work towards your goals, and indeed have tried to forget about your goals completely. Being content just feels so unnatural, however. You can't push the ambitions from your mind, and finally have to admit defeat. It isn't working.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_arbitrary;For weeks you have tried to be just in the way everyone expects. You've made every attempt to care about what's right and what's wrong, listened to your advisors, but it just seems so...pointless. You don't think you truly have a sense of justice, no matter how much you try. It's time to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2637;I will try again -- I must!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_lustful;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and your duties, attempting to put all lustful thoughts aside...and, to your surprise, it has worked. Perhaps whatever needs such thoughts served has been replaced by your love of God. Whatever the case, you now feel you can move forward, pure in deed as well as mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_gluttonous;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and temperance, eating lightly and avoiding excess...and, to your surprise, it has worked. Your appetite has been replaced by a love of God and, while you may never be truly temperate, you can at least rest assured your gluttonous nature has been defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_greedy;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and charity...and, to your surprise, it has worked. Giving to others actually feels *good*. You never thought it would, really. No-one will ever accuse you of being truly charitable, but your overwhelming desire to accumulate things for yourself seems to have passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_slothful;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and your duties...and, to your surprise, it has worked. You have never felt so alive and full of energy. Granted, it's difficult and you are exhausted all the time, but you look back on the way you were and can only shake your head at all the years wasted doing nothing useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_envious;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and kind thoughts...and, to your surprise, it has worked. All the spite you used to feel just seems to take so much *energy*, you now can't imagine why you did it. Nobody will accuse you of being kind, perhaps, but a little of your love of God has now spread to others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_cruel;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and kind deeds...and, to your surprise, it has worked. Cruelty does not come quite so quickly as it used to, and it shocks you how good it feels to be generous from time to time. Perhaps such dark thoughts simply cannot survive in the light of God's love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_wroth;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and patience...and, to your surprise, it has worked. There have been no bouts of rage, no lashing out at anyone. When your old temper begins to rise, you think of God and it all seems to...melt away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_proud;Humility does not come easy. For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer, and to thinking of others before yourself. To your surprise, doing so feels good. The way they smile is a reward in and of itself, even if you get nothing else out of it. Perhaps this is what God's love truly means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_deceitful;For weeks you have been nothing but scrupulously honest, dedicating yourself to prayer and avoiding twisty thoughts of intrigue. To your surprise, it has worked. It has become easier and easier just to speak your heart, and you find yourself regretting the fact you ever felt the need to deceive others at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_ambitious;Putting aside your ambitions has not been easy. For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and made no plans, and for a while it made you mad to feel so idle...and then, one morning, you just let it go. God shall provide, or shall not. Perhaps it truly is that simple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_arbitrary;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer, and to dealing with supplicants in the fairest manner possible. It all seemed like such pointless work, and so aggravating, until one day you realize right and wrong isn't so complicated. God's love is justice, and knowing that makes it so much easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2638;God has given me a gift, and I shall not squander it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2639;There are those who question your mystic pursuits, wondering whether this is the act of a pious [Root.GetManWoman] of God or the dabblings of a pagan. You insist that it is the former, but perhaps not everyone will see it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2639;Am I not a good Christian?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2640;There are those who question your more...violent...interests, wondering whether these are the efforts of a zealous [Root.GetManWoman] of God or the darker urges of a criminal. You insist that it is the former, but perhaps not everyone will see it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2640;I do what I do for God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2641;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your chaste nature becomes better-known to those around you. Priests in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] mention you in their sermons, saying that others should take their example from you and put aside their own lustful thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2641;All should strive for virtue;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2642;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your vow of celibacy becomes better-known to those around you.

EVTDESC_Plus_2644;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your kind nature becomes better-known to those around you. The people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] consider you a generous ruler, untouched by the harsh world, and an example to others who seem to know only hate and cruelty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2645;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your humility becomes better-known to those around you. Priests in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] mention you in their sermons, saying that others should take their example from you and put aside their own pride and concern for only themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2646;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your honest nature becomes better-known to those around you. Indeed, you recently told the truth to a visiting courtier when a lie would have served you far better...and the man was so impressed he told the tale far and wide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2647;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your sense of justice becomes better-known to those around you. The people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] consider you a fair and wise ruler, trusting your edicts like they would almost no other, and an example to selfish rulers elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2648;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your devotion to theology has gained you a great deal of admiration. '[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is a true Christian scholar,' they say, and many eagerly await copies of your studies on God and true faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2649;There are those who have questioned the voice you claim to hear, suggesting it is not Jesus but a demon, or worse. Now it seems that tide has turned, and more people in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are realizing that perhaps you do have a connection to the Divine, that you have been touched by God Himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2649;Jesus shall guide them, as he does me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2652;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] now leads the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], but our allegiance was to the [former_khan.GetOnlyDynastyName] Clan and not to the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] Clan. Perhaps it is time for the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] to strike out on its own and seek its own fortunes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2652;We will not follow [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2652;No, [From.GetSheHe] is the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], at least for now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2653;Dire news: [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has elected to split off from the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], citing that [From.GetHerHis] allegiance was to the [former_khan.GetOnlyDynastyName] Clan and not to your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_Plus_2655;The Death of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2655_two;While [nomadic_first_heir.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is widely recognized as [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s chosen heir, there is also widespread support amongst the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] Clan for [nomadic_second_heir.GetFirstName]. With the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] having grown so large, some [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] warriors have declared they will follow him into a new clan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2655_three;While [nomadic_first_heir.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is widely recognized as [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s chosen heir, there is also widespread support amongst the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] Clan for [nomadic_second_heir.GetFirstName] and [nomadic_third_heir.GetFirstName].

EVTDESC_Plus_2655_four;While [nomadic_first_heir.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is widely recognized as [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s chosen heir, there is also widespread support amongst the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] Clan for his other sons: [nomadic_second_heir.GetFirstName], [nomadic_third_heir.GetFirstName], and [nomadic_fourth_heir.GetFirstName]. With the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] having grown so large, some [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] warriors have declared they will follow them into new clans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2655;They would split [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] apart?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2655;I will take my place as a new leader;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2655;Such is how it must be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2655;Perhaps this will finally weaken them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2659;Now that I am the head of my own clan, I must consider whether I wish to remain in the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] under the leadership of my brother. If I split off, it is possible that other clans might choose to join me...or I could be completely on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2659;I will forge my own destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2659;I will remain in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], at least for now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2660;To my liege and [GetFromRelation],\nA number of clansmen from the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] Clan have joined my ranks, and I have decided to split off from the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] and forge my own destiny.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2661;The [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] Clan has decided to split off from the [nomadic_first_heir.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], and since your lands border my own I invite you to join us in forging a new destiny.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2661;Yes, we will join him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2661;No, we will remain in [nomadic_first_heir.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_2700;By enacting this decision you will forever cause a rift between the latin and greek sides of Christendom or in other words causing the schism. Catholicism and Orthodoxy will wholly replace Chalcedonian over the course of the next few weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_Plus_2751;The Invasion of Neustria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2751;A Viking warrior by the name of Rollo has collected a rather large band of followers over his years as a raider in the North Sea, and now rumor has it that he has set his sights on the northern coast of Neustria.

EVTDESC_Plus_2751_immediate;A Viking warrior by the name of Rollo has collected a rather large band of followers over his years as a raider in the North Sea, and now he has landed upon the northern coast of Neustria and siezed several of its castles and cities. Many fear this Norseman will use Rouen as a base from which to launch further raids and thus terrorize the entirety of northern Francia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2751;Glory for the Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2751;They're coming *here*?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2753;Ruling in a strange land has been difficult, but the longer you remain in [Root.Capital.GetName] the more you hear about this Christian God and His ways. Considering that, more and more, your court is beginning to take on the language and mannerisms of the Franks, perhaps it would be easier to accept this new religion than fight against it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2753;I shall embrace this new God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2753;Never! My faith in Odin is absolute!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2754;The war is not going well. Those within your war council have uneasily advised that perhaps the best route would be to kneel before [christian_liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and offer to accept the Christian faith. To not do so might mean the loss of everything you've attempted to build in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2754;I will bend knee before this [christian_liege.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_2756;Facing an ignominious loss in his war against the Christians, [Root.GetTitledName] has bent the knee to [From.GetTitledName] and converted to the Christian faith. In truth, there are many who say the Norsemen of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have already taken on the language and customs of the Franks, and that this embracing of a new culture and liege was simply making official what was already in truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2756;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_2800;As you wander the markets you notice a new trend of religously themed kilim. Some are more vibrant in colours with fanciful shapes, while others are more simple.\n\nAfter wandering past the stalls for a while you wonder if perhaps you should buy one for yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_Plus_2800;A modest one is fine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2800;The cheap one will do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2800;Bah, I don't need a new kilim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2801;It would seem some ill-advised bets you took in the past have come back to haunt you.\nYou ponder about making an even bigger bet to pay off your debt and seeking aid from Afri, the goddess of fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_Plus_2902;They will both pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3202_inherit;With the passing of [former_viceroy.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [From.GetFirstName] has inherited the [viceroy_title.GetFullName]. Under the laws of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], [From.GetSheHe] may only retain the [viceroy_title.GetTier] with your assent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3202_usurp;News has reached [Root.Capital.GetName] that [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has taken the [viceroy_title.GetFullName] by force, and thus rules without imperial assent. You could grant [From.GetHerHim] that right, or your could deny [From.GetHerHim] victory...though doing so may mean rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3202;[From.GetSheHeCap] may keep the title;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3202;No, [From.GetSheHe] may not hold the [viceroy_title.GetTier];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3203;To my loyal subject,\nI hereby grant imperial assent for you to hold the [viceroy_title.GetFullName]. Rule over it wisely, in my name and in the best interests of the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3203;My thanks to the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3204;To my loyal subject,\nI am afraid I must inform you that I cannot provide imperial assent for you to hold the [viceroy_title.GetFullName]. My councillors will determine who in the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] is best suited to become [viceroy_title.GetRulerTitle].\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3204;Accept [From.GetHerHis] decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3204;Offer [From.GetHerHim] a favor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_3204;Call in my favor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_3204;Offer [From.GetHerHim] a gift;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_3204;[From.GetSheHeCap] can take the title from my cold, dead hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3205;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nI hope there is a way I might retain rulership over the [viceroy_title.GetFullName], but I bow to your wisdom.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3206;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nI acknowledge that you have every right to deny me the [viceroy_title.GetFullName], but I hope that you will see the wisdom in reversing your decision. I am not without resources, after all, and would consider it a personal favor -- one you might have use of in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3206;I will change my mind for a favor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3206;I have no need of a favor from [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3207;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nYou are wiser than I supposed, and your offer of a favor in exchange for your retention of the [viceroy_title.GetFullName] is hereby accepted.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3208;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI have no need of a favor from you. Either think of something better to offer, or accept my decision with a modicum of grace.\n\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3209;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nWhile I acknowledge your right to deny me the [viceroy_title.GetFullName], I am forced to remind you of the favor you owe me. I hereby call it in, in exchange for the right to continue to hold the title.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3210;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\nI acknowledge that you have every right to deny me the [viceroy_title.GetFullName], but I hope that you will see the wisdom in reversing your decision. I am a [From.GetManWoman] with resources, resources that I am more than willing to share with a benevolent liege.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3210;Accept [From.GetHerHis] generous offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3210;I will not be bribed like a common bureaucrat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3211;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nYou are wiser than I had supposed, and your offer of a gift in exchange for your retention of the [viceroy_title.GetFullName] is hereby accepted.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3212;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI find your attempt at a bribe, like a was a common bureaucrat in need of having [From.GetHerHis] palm greased, to be insulting. If you have nothing more to say, than accept my decision with whatever grace you have left.\n\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3214;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI will not have my titles ripped from me without a fight. I shall see you on the battlefield.\n\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3215_no_change;Your council deliberates for long hours before returning to you with their reluctant verdict: [current_viceroy.GetFirstName] is the only candidate they can agree on who is qualified to hold the [viceroy_title.GetFullName], and they suggest you reverse your decision and grant [current_viceroy.GetHerHim] the title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3215_one_choice;Your council deliberates for long hours before returning to you with the name of the one [council_first_pick.GetManWoman] they feel is best suited to hold the [viceroy_title.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3215_several_choices;Your council deliberates for long hours before returning to you with the names of those they feel are most suited to hold the [viceroy_title.GetFullName]. It is not a long list.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3215_default;I suppose I have no option but to accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3215_no_change;[current_viceroy.GetFirstName] shall keep the title after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3215;I choose [council_first_pick.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3215;I choose [council_second_pick.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_3215;I choose [council_third_pick.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_3215;I will decide for myself who gets the title;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3216;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nAfter no small amount of deliberation, my council and I have decided it is best if you keep the [viceroy_title.GetFullName] after all. Congradulations!\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3216;I am most relieved to hear it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3217;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nAfter no small amount of deliberation, my council and I have decided that you are best suited to administer to the [viceroy_title.GetFullName] on behalf of myself and the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. This is an additional responsibility that I know you will approach with wisdom.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3301;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], has approached you with a request: [From.GetSheHe] wants to travel to [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName] and spend time in the service of the empire. Even if nothing comes of it, [From.GetSheHe] hopes the experience will be of benefit, and promises to return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3301;Refuse [From.GetHerHis] request;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3301;Let [From.GetHerHim] go;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3303;To my [GetFromReverseRelation],\nAs it turns out, [From.Liege.Capital.GetName] has been good to me. [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has seen fit to provide me a position wherein I can serve all of [From.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName], so I don't think I'll be returning to [Root.Capital.GetName] soon...if at all.\n\nMay [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] be with you,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3306;[From.GetTitledName] has returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], though not quite in the condition [From.GetSheHe] left in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3308;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], having received a fair amount of education while serving in [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3314;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], but it seems he's brought a souvenir from [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court: a wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3316_male;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], but it seems he's brought a souvenir from [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court: a bastard son who he claims is his own, though he refuses to speak of the mother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3316_female;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], but it seems she's brought a souvenir from [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court: a bastard son who she claims is her own, though she refuses to speak of the father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3318;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], but whatever [From.GetSheHe] had hoped to find in [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court it seems to have eluded [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] mostly remains in [From.GetHerHis] quarters since [From.GetHerHis] return, a black cloud of depression hanging over [From.GetHerHis] head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3320;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], and it appears the duty and honor [From.GetSheHe] went looking for in [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court was found at the bottom of a bottle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3322;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], and it appears the time spent serving in [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court has made [From.GetHerHim] a much more diligent [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3324;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], and it appears [From.GetSheHe] did practically nothing during those years other than ply away the time in [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court...an idleness that [From.GetSheHe] is now very much accustomed to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3326;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], and it appears the majority of [From.GetHerHis] time was spent serving [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] rather than [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has become quite a zealous [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3328;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], and it seems the time spent in [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court has made [From.GetHerHim] into quite the cynic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_Plus_3341;I need to warn [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3342;A bit of worrying news: [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] did not show up at a meeting to go over the plan. [From.GetSheHeCap] may have had second thoughts about taking part in the palace coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3342_informed;A bit of worrying news: [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] did not show up at a meeting to go over the plan. Not only that, your sources tell you [From.GetSheHe] may have informed [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] of the coming danger, though [From.GetSheHe] did not know enough to overly endanger you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3343;My liege,\nWhile I cannot go into a great amount of detail, I feel I must inform you that you are in danger. There are those within the imperial palace who prepare to move against you and steal your throne.\n\nBe very careful,\n[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3343;Someone's planning a coup, are they?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_3348;As the hour grows dark in the [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName] imperial palace, suddenly there is shouting from the shadowy halls. You hear the sound of steel on steel, of men engaged in combat, and someone shouts 'Treachery!' A battle is underway!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3348;Who is behind this?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3349;The fighting within the imperial palace is vicious, and while you do your best to avoid the worst of it you are still confronted by an imperial guard. After a brief struggle you manage to kill the man, but not before he stabs you in the side...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3349;Just my luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3350;The fighting within the imperial palace is vicious, and you almost don't know where to turn. You see what you think is an imperial guard and run towards him, but realize too late from the gleam in his eye that he is, in fact, one of the traitors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3350;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3351;Battles rage through the halls of the imperial palace, and just as [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] turns a corner [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is suddenly attacked by an imperial guard. Before the guard can impale [FromFrom.GetHerHim] with his sword, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] barrels into him from behind and knocks him over, saving [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_3353;During the course of the battle in the palace, [coup_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] turns a corner and spots [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] down a long hall.

EVTOPTB_Plus_3353;If I survive tonight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3354;Things are not going well. Already you see your forces scattering, routed, and just as you are about to give the order to retreat you are stabbed from behind by an imperial guard.

EVTOPTA_Plus_3354;Damn, I was so close!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3355;Things are going well. Your guardsmen have the coup well in hand, and just before you declare the imperial palace retaken you feel a knife stabbing you from behind.

EVTDESC_Plus_3357;Things appear to be going well. You men have the imperial guard on the run, and most of the palace is already under your control.

EVTOPTA_Plus_3358;Who is behind this? They will pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3359;Everywhere you turn there is a bloody battle. Worse, your imperial guardsmen appear to be losing!

Ultimately the plotters failed, though not before both [coup_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] were slain during all the fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3360;There will be consequences for this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_3361_1;Word is quickly spreading throughout the [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] of a successful coup in [coup_target.Capital.GetName]. Forces led by [Root.GetBestName] stormed the imperial palace while [coup_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] was away, successfully overcoming the imperial guard and seizing the throne. A large number of plotters evidently worked with [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to achieve this victory, and are reassuring the empire of [Root.GetHerHis] rightful claim even as the former [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] plots [coup_target.GetHerHis] revenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3361_2;Word is quickly spreading throughout the [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] of a successful coup in [coup_target.Capital.GetName]. Forces led by [Root.GetBestName] stormed the imperial palace in the night, successfully overcoming the imperial guard and seizing the throne. A large number of plotters evidently worked with [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to achieve this victory, and are reassuring the empire of [Root.GetHerHis] rightful claim even as the former [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] plots [coup_target.GetHerHis] revenge following a quick escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3361_3;Word is quickly spreading throughout the [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] of a successful coup in [coup_target.Capital.GetName].

A large number of plotters evidently worked with [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to achieve this victory, and are reassuring the empire of [Root.GetHerHis] rightful claim to the title [Root.GetSheHe] now holds in truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3361_4;Word is quickly spreading throughout the [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] of a successful coup in [coup_target.Capital.GetName].

EVTDESC_Plus_3369;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nMy time in [From.Location.GetName] wears on me, and I yearn for opportunities elsewhere in the empire. Perhaps I might find a place in your court at [Root.Capital.GetName]? I think you could find my skills a useful addition to your council.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3369;You would be most welcome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3369;No, I think not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3375;There has been considerable talk within the court regarding corruption in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], and now [bureaucrat.GetBestName] has approached you with a proposal for several laws that will ideally reform the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3375;That sounds like an excellent idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3375;No, not right now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3376;[bureaucrat.GetBestName] has approached the court with a proposal to reform imperial taxes, something which has gained a great deal of popularity within the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] bureaucracy even if it's hardly guaranteed to have the effect [bureaucrat.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] promises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3377;The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] bureaucracy is a thing that sometimes seems to have a life of its own, and while it is needed to run the empire sometimes things just get lost within its labyrinthine rules and corrupt practices...such as your taxes, for instance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3377;What? The culprits must be found!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3378;With each passing year, it seems that the bureaucracy required to keep the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] gets larger and larger. So many of the lord and ladies within your court appear to have greater knowledge of how the bureaucracy works than you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3379;The intrigues within the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] court are many. The latest has come with an offer: [courtier.GetBestName] believes [courtier.GetSheHe] can help you with a vassal who doesn't like you very much, at least for a time. Why [courtier.GetSheHe] wishes to help you, you're not even quite certain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3379;Do what you can;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3379;I don't need help with [problem_vassal.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3380;You weren't even present when it happened: evidently [first_courtier.GetBestName] and [second_courtier.GetBestName] had some kind of argument during court, something which has become increasingly vicious over the last several days as each of them drags more fellow courtiers into their feud. Both have approached you to ask for your support against the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3380;Support [first_courtier.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3380;Support [second_courtier.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_3380;Do not get me involved in this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_3380;I will help them work this out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3381;The imperial court is a living, breathing organ within the palace. Lords and ladies come and go, plotting behind their smiles and doing their best to climb up the social ladder and into your good graces as if you didn't notice their maneuvering to get there. Is this truly what the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] has come to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3382;[guard.GetBestName] has approached you with a proposal to reform the regulations used to raise and train the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] levies. [guard.GetHerHisCap] ideas have a great deal of support within the court, though others say they also have a good chance of going very wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3383;You have always enjoyed a cadre of personal guard to protect your person, but recently [guard.GetBestName] has proven [guard.GetHerHis] loyalty and determination to be the best of them. Indeed, just the other day [guard.GetSheHe] stopped a would-be assassin from entering the palace grounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3383;Well done! I feel safer already;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_3385;A Hero Rises;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3385;With [From.GetHerHis] performance at the Battle of [From.Location.GetName] receiving notice throughout the empire, many are declaring [From.GetBestName] a [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] hero - the sort that tales are told of and, some suggest, the sort who rise to themselves become [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3385;Oh, is that so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3385;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3386;Recently there has been talk within the court of how capable [guard.GetBestName] is. They laud [guard.GetHerHis] martial prowess, and implicit within their whispers is that the [guard.GetManWoman] is a better warrior than you...the sort of warrior who could do great things if [guard.GetSheHe] were to rule the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3386;It had best remain talk, and nothing more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3600;Assyrian culture has been present since antiquity in the Levant and Mesopotamia and ruled much of it under the guidance of powerful kings. Later on, Saint Nestorius founded our very own church, distinct from the other Arab Christians. We speak our own language and maintain our own traditions, as we have for millenia. To some, we are the only true heirs of Syria and Mesopotamia unlike the Muslim Arabs. As I am a Nestorian myself, perhaps it is time I embrace that distinction from the Arabs around me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3600;Yes, I am Assyrian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3600;No, there is no point;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3601;The Nestorian Arabs in [Root.GetName] have slowly begun to adopt the language and traditions of the Assyrian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3602;While I am in every way Assyrian, I am not Nestorian, and it seems pointless to hold onto outdated ways that are so closely tied to the Nestorian faith, does it not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3602;True, I am really an Levantine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3602;No, I am Assyrian and will remain thus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3603;With the people in [Root.GetName] no longer clinging to the Nestorian faith, their Assyrian traditions and language have begun to fall to the wayside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_REP_61;A glorious future awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_10001;I believe it really is [From.Reincarnation.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RoI_10001;No, that's nonsense;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_10011;The cycle of rebirth is remarkable indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RoI_10020;How has justice not been done?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_101;The First Temple, built by King Solomon, was destroyed by the invading Babylonians. The Second Temple, built under the auspices of Cyrus the Great of Persia, was razed by the Romans after a terrible siege. The Third Temple, however, built by the great [Root.GetTitledFirstName], shall stand for all eternity!\n\nFrom its position on Temple Mount, the magnificent building has become a dominant feature of Jerusalem, instantly recognizable from far away by travellers approaching the city. [new_kohen_gadol.GetTitledName] has assumed [new_kohen_gadol.GetHerHis] position as the first Kohen Gadol is the Second Temple's destruction, leading a rebuilding of the Jewish priesthood who can now be seen throughout Jerusalem on a daily basis. Truly, Solomon himself would have been moved to tears by the sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_504;Next year in Jerusalem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_504;Once more in Jerusalem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_590;There has not been a Kohen Gadol – a High Priest of Judaism – since the Romans destroyed the Second Temple roughly a thousand years ago. At long last, this position has been filled and the High Priesthood reconstituted.\n\nThe Samaritans have held the tradition of a Kohen Gadol steadfast, despite their exile from the Holy Land and so the Kohen Gadol himself now returns to where he belongs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOA_1051;Most righteous [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nThe [holy_order_name.GetFullName] needs more castles in order to train troops and generate a supporting income.

EVTDESC_SOA_1209;Harkening back to the early days of Islam, the Ansar have adopted the name given to Muhammad's first allies in Medina, who helped the Prophet's companions in the war against the Quraysh.

EVTOPTA_SoA_5039;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] is showing me the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5056;As you walk around on this holy ground, you ponder the secrets and the essence of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].

EVTDESC_SoA_5057;The scriptures, the buildings, this holy ground, how it all moves my soul! I realize now that all my life up to this point has only been a preparation for this journey. How wondrous that the light of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] truly shines in me, a humble servant. From now on I shall always do His work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5061;The stories of other pilgrims all spoke of how impressive this place is. Now that you can see it with your own eyes, you can only join in their praise. You are glad that you came here, to one of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith's most holy places.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5064;Near the holy sites, you hear rumors of a group of [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s with strange cures for diseases. Eagerly, you seek them out, hoping against hope that they may aid you. Once in their care you are fed strange potions, foods and herbs. You are unconscious or delirious during most of the process and remember few details, but at last you wake up to find that you have been miraculously healed of your ills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_3101;News has arrived that a new island in the far north-west has been discovered, by a viking of the name 'Naddoddur'. The claims of this viking have even been confirmed by a second by the name of 'Garðarr Svávarsson'. The name 'Iceland' has begun to come in use for this new island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3101;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3102;Further news of this 'Iceland' has arrived. It would seem vikings, unhappy with the current state of their homeland, have begun earnest attempts at settling the land there. Word is that, despite the name, it is a rather hospitable and fertile island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3102;What a tale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3103;Even more news from Iceland. It would seem the settlement of the island is finally complete and a gathering of its inhabitants was held, called the 'Alþingi' to discuss matters of the island. It was held at the Lögberg, or Law Rock. It would seem the island now has the beginnings of a proper realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3103;They've come a long way;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2701;This event will allow you to replace the religions of the entire world with pagan equivalents. It will leave the currently existing political entities in place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_1703;With the separation from the Byzantine Empire the local culture in the county of [Root.GetName] has evolved over time into something new.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1703;Welcome into the fold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1871;Which empire should I give to my vassal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1871;[From.GetSheHeCap] can have my old empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1871;My second empire is a better choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SSI_74;As an Aztec count on Atlantic coast you can claim the Aztec Empire and begin the conquest of Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SSI_74;Give me the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SSI_74;I don't want this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_1763;It seems I have an opportunity to acquire a different education. But this will be at a significant cost, will take several years, and may reduce my current education tier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1763;I need different skills!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1764;Which education would be most helpful to have? Let's see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_4150;It would seem a Jewish community in your demesne has decided to pack up their belongings and leave for Israel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_4150;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_4151;My liege, I bring terrible news from the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. The Jewish merchants that you wisely allowed to settle in the city have grown dissatisfied with your rule. They've decided to pack up their things and return to their homeland of Israel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_4151;What a bunch of ingrates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_4152;It would seem that a group of fellow Jews have returned to their rightful home of Israel all the way from [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. You organize the immediate resettling of them in your lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_4152;Mazel Tov!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_681;For as long as we have lived as refugees we spoke the tongue of old only in secret. This has begun changing as now that we no longer need to hide ourselves from those who would perscute us based on our beliefs. As we grew up, we returned to speaking our common tongue of Hebrew. Perhaps it is time to once again embrace this tongue so that we all may communicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_682;It seems that the old Hebrew language has now returned to majority use in [Root.GetName], and with it a new culture born from a mix of the old and new ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_683;Having fled to all corners of the world the Jewish people adopted various local languages but we've always had one common tongue, Hebrew. I have therefore prevailed upon a member of my court to adopt this for everyday administrative use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Never again shall they be exiled from their own lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_706;The holy fast of Yom Kippur is soon upon us and all faithful Jews, save the infirm and those on a journey, must observe the fast during a 25 hour period after the Seudah Mafseket.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA706;G'mar Hatima Tova!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_707;The fast and observance of the holy day of Yom Kippur has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_708;Yom Kippur approaches and that means the Seudah Mafseket is soon upon us. The preparations for the planned feast to celebrate this have already been made and now the time has come to invite your vassals to your palace. What say you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_709;To celebrate Yom Kippur perhaps you should present a gift to your beloved wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_710;Yom Kippur is a blessed time for charity and kindness and in that spirit you could release the prisoners languishing in your dungeons...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_711;Hashem teaches the importance of charity and good deeds. There are many poor in [Root.Location.GetName] who could be helped if you but parted with some of your treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_712;Now is the time for prayers and devoted reading of the Torah. After the sun has set, you could recite the Kol Nidre at the evening service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA712;Yes, I will thus draw nearer to Hashem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_713;The fast you have observed during Yom Kippur has taught you the value of moderation in all things and the dangers of indulgence and excess. You feel closer to Hashem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_714;You have given generously to the poor during Yom Kippur and performed many good deeds. The urge to help those in need comes naturally to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_716;To [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI give thanks for your invitation to celebrate Yom Kippur at your palace, but I regret to inform you I cannot attend.\n\nYour servant,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_PLUS_717;Seudah Mafseket is held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_717;The great banquet you ordered held to celebrate the start of Yom Kippur was a rousing success! The food was exceptional, the entertainment magnificent and a great time was had by all. Your guests seemed suitably impressed by your wealth and generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_PLUS_718;Seudah Mafseket is attended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_718;The great banquet held by [From.GetTitledName] to celebrate the start of Yom Kippur was a splendid occasion. The food was exceptional, the entertainment magnificent and a great time was had by all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_719;To [Root.GetTitledName]. The start of Yom Kippur draws nea, and to celebrate I have decided to hold a great feast in my palace. You are of course invited.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_722;Though the fast requires you to abstain from food and drink you helped yourself to enough wine to fall into a drunken stupor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_723;Many in [Root.Location.GetName] have donated generously to provide for the poor during as a result of Yom Kippur. The gold has been gathered in an urn but when you approach it to donate your own share, your greedy nature results in your coin purse gaining weight instead of losing it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_724;As a cynical unbeliever you do your best to uphold the appearance of observing the fast but behind closed doors you do not think twice about eating and drinking to your heart's content. Despite your best attempts however you are caught in the act...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50006B;My prisoner, [From.GetBestName], is complaining about the horrible smell in the dungeon, asking for more suitable accommodations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1764;Diplomacy is the key to the future;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA_Plus_1765;I want the best education money can buy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_Plus_1765;I will spend moderately;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_Plus_1765;Anything is better than what I have now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_Plus_1768;A new court educator [new_educator.GetBestName] has arrived at my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_Plus_1772;Finally! I have finished my re-education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_Plus_1773;I have trouble retaining everything I learn and it's becoming more and more difficult to follow the lessons;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_Plus_1773;Persist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_Plus_1773;Take it easy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_Plus_1774;A heated debate with my educator somehow got out of hand and we turned to insults.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_Plus_1774;Try to talk with them;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_Plus_1774;My word is final!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_Plus_1775;A new book was recently published, and it may benefit my education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_Plus_1775;This is exactly what I need;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_Plus_1775;Aren't all books the same?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_Plus_1776;I've discovered an ancient dusty tome in my library. If I study it, I'm sure I will impress the court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_Plus_1776;Spend the night studying;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_Plus_1776;I'll rather get some sleep;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_Plus_1777;My lover [Root.Lover.GetFirstName] is free tonight, but if I spend time with [Root.Lover.GetHerHim] I will fall behind on my lessons;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_Plus_1777;Education is more important;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_Plus_1777;Love comes first;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTX_GoPagan_100;We will take a secret path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTF_Plus_1764;My current educator has exactly what I need;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTG_Plus_1764;I want to hire a different educator;;;;;;;;;;;;;
