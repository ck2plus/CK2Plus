EVTDESC_Plus_3301;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], has approached you with a request: [From.GetSheHe] wants to travel to [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName] and spend time in the service of the empire. Even if nothing comes of it, [From.GetSheHe] hopes the experience will be of benefit, and promises to return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3301;Refuse [From.GetHerHis] request;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3301;Let [From.GetHerHim] go;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3303;To my [GetFromReverseRelation],\nAs it turns out, [From.Liege.Capital.GetName] has been good to me. [From.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has seen fit to provide me a position wherein I can serve all of [From.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName], so I don't think I'll be returning to [Root.Capital.GetName] soon...if at all.\n\nMay [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] be with you,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3306;[From.GetTitledName] has returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], though not quite in the condition [From.GetSheHe] left in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3308;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], having received a fair amount of education while serving in [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3314;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], but it seems he's brought a souvenir from [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court: a wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3316_male;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], but it seems he's brought a souvenir from [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court: a bastard son who he claims is his own, though he refuses to speak of the mother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3316_female;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], but it seems she's brought a souvenir from [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court: a bastard son who she claims is her own, though she refuses to speak of the father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3318;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], but whatever [From.GetSheHe] had hoped to find in [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court it seems to have eluded [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] mostly remains in [From.GetHerHis] quarters since [From.GetHerHis] return, a black cloud of depression hanging over [From.GetHerHis] head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3320;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], and it appears the duty and honor [From.GetSheHe] went looking for in [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court was found at the bottom of a bottle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3322;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], and it appears the time spent serving in [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court has made [From.GetHerHim] a much more diligent [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3324;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], and it appears [From.GetSheHe] did practically nothing during those years other than ply away the time in [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court...an idleness that [From.GetSheHe] is now very much accustomed to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3326;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], and it appears the majority of [From.GetHerHis] time was spent serving [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] rather than [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has become quite a zealous [From.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3328;[From.GetTitledName] has finally returned home from [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName], and it seems the time spent in [Root.TopLiege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s court has made [From.GetHerHim] into quite the cynic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_Plus_3341;I'm still in;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3341;No, this is too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_3341;I need to warn [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3342;A bit of worrying news: [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] did not show up at a meeting to go over the plan. [From.GetSheHeCap] may have had second thoughts about taking part in the palace coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3342_informed;A bit of worrying news: [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] did not show up at a meeting to go over the plan. Not only that, your sources tell you [From.GetSheHe] may have informed [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] of the coming danger, though [From.GetSheHe] did not know enough to overly endanger you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3343;My liege,\nWhile I cannot go into a great amount of detail, I feel I must inform you that you are in danger. There are those within the imperial palace who prepare to move against you and steal your throne.\n\nBe very careful,\n[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3343;Someone's planning a coup, are they?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3344_low;Everyone within the imperial palace is in place. While they are all nervous over their chances against the guard, they await your order to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3344_med;Everyone within the imperial palace is in place. It will be a risk for them all, but they appear to feel their chances are good and await your order to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3344_high;Everyone within the imperial palace is in place. The general feeling is that they are sure of victory, and await your order to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_Plus_3344;Give the order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3344;No, we wait for a better moment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_3344;Abandon the plot -- it's not going to happen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3345;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI thank you for your willingness to take part in my plot, but I fear now is not the moment to strike. Our time shall come again soon.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3348;As the hour grows dark in the [Root.TopLiege.Capital.GetName] imperial palace, suddenly there is shouting from the shadowy halls. You hear the sound of steel on steel, of men engaged in combat, and someone shouts 'Treachery!' A battle is underway!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3348;Who is behind this?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3349;The fighting within the imperial palace is vicious, and while you do your best to avoid the worst of it you are still confronted by an imperial guard. After a brief struggle you manage to kill the man, but not before he stabs you in the side...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3349;Just my luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3350;The fighting within the imperial palace is vicious, and you almost don't know where to turn. You see what you think is an imperial guard and run towards him, but realize too late from the gleam in his eye that he is, in fact, one of the traitors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3350;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3351;Battles rage through the halls of the imperial palace, and just as [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] turns a corner [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is suddenly attacked by an imperial guard. Before the guard can impale [FromFrom.GetHerHim] with his sword, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] barrels into him from behind and knocks him over, saving [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3351;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap]'s lucky I was there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3351;I'm lucky [From.GetSheHe] was there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3352;Battles rage through the halls of the imperial palace, and just as [coup_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] turns a corner [coup_target.GetSheHe] is suddenly attacked by a treacherous soldier. Before the soldier can impale [coup_target.GetHerHim] with his sword, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] barrels into him from behind and knocks him over, saving the [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3352;[coup_target.GetSheHeCap]'s lucky I was there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3352;I'm lucky [From.GetSheHe] was there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3353;During the course of the battle in the palace, [coup_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] turns a corner and spots [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] down a long hall. Their eyes meet, and the [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] knows right then that this [From.GetManWoman] is one of the traitors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3353;If I survive tonight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3354;Things are not going well. Already you see your forces scattering, routed, and just as you are about to give the order to retreat you are stabbed from behind by an imperial guard. He is cut down by several of your own men, but even so you feel blackness closing in on you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3354;Damn, I was so close!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3355;Things are going well. Your guardsmen have the coup well in hand, and just before you declare the imperial palace retaken you feel a knife stabbing you from behind. The assassin is cut down by several of your own men, but even so you feel blackness closing in on you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3355;No, this cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3356;You are in [Root.Location.GetName] when you receive word of a disturbance at the imperial palace back at [Root.Capital.GetName]. Someone attempted to engineer a coup while you were away, and while the details are still scarce the good news is that it seems their efforts will come to naught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3356;The perpetrators will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3357;Things appear to be going well. You men have the imperial guard on the run, and most of the palace is already under your control. Just as the last holdouts begin surrendering and you prepare to declare the coup a success, you feel a knife stabbing you from behind. The soldier is cut down by several of your own, but even so you feel blackness closing in on you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3358;You are in [Root.Location.GetName] when you receive word of a disturbance at the imperial palace back at [Root.Capital.GetName]. Someone is attempting to engineer a coup while you are away, and while the details are still scarce it seems the worst may come to pass...they may actually succeed. You gather what men you can and start racing back to the capital, but it is likely far too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3358;Who is behind this? They will pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3359;Everywhere you turn there is a bloody battle. Worse, your imperial guardsmen appear to be losing! Just as the few men who remain at your side advise you to flee the imperial palace, you feel a knife stabbing into your back. The assassin is quickly cut down, but even so you feel blackness closing in on you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3359;Is this how it all ends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_3360;Battle in the Palace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3360_1;Word is quickly spreading throughout the [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] of an attempted coup in [coup_target.Capital.GetName]. A pitched battle took place in the imperial palace, with forces led by [Root.GetBestName] attempting to seize the throne while [coup_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] was away from the capital.

EVTOPTB_Plus_3360;There will be consequences for this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_3361;[coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetName] Overthrown!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3361_1;Word is quickly spreading throughout the [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] of a successful coup in [coup_target.Capital.GetName]. Forces led by [Root.GetBestName] stormed the imperial palace while [coup_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] was away, successfully overcoming the imperial guard and seizing the throne. A large number of plotters evidently worked with [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to achieve this victory, and are reassuring the empire of [Root.GetHerHis] rightful claim even as the former [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] plots [coup_target.GetHerHis] revenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3361_2;Word is quickly spreading throughout the [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] of a successful coup in [coup_target.Capital.GetName]. Forces led by [Root.GetBestName] stormed the imperial palace in the night, successfully overcoming the imperial guard and seizing the throne.

EVTDESC_Plus_3361_3;Word is quickly spreading throughout the [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] of a successful coup in [coup_target.Capital.GetName]. Forces led by [Root.GetBestName] stormed the imperial palace in the night, successfully overcoming the imperial guard and not only seizing the throne but capturing [coup_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] as well.

EVTDESC_Plus_3361_4;Word is quickly spreading throughout the [coup_target.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] of a successful coup in [coup_target.Capital.GetName].

A large number of plotters evidently worked with [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to achieve this victory, and are reassuring the empire of [Root.GetHerHis] rightful claim to the title [Root.GetSheHe] now holds in truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3369;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nMy time in [From.Location.GetName] wears on me, and I yearn for opportunities elsewhere in the empire. Perhaps I might find a place in your court at [Root.Capital.GetName]? I think you could find my skills a useful addition to your council.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3369;You would be most welcome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3369;No, I think not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3375;There has been considerable talk within the court regarding corruption in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], and now [bureaucrat.GetBestName] has approached you with a proposal for several laws that will ideally reform the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3375;That sounds like an excellent idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3375;No, not right now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3376;[bureaucrat.GetBestName] has approached the court with a proposal to reform imperial taxes, something which has gained a great deal of popularity within the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] bureaucracy even if it's hardly guaranteed to have the effect [bureaucrat.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] promises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3377;The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] bureaucracy is a thing that sometimes seems to have a life of its own, and while it is needed to run the empire sometimes things just get lost within its labyrinthine rules and corrupt practices...such as your taxes, for instance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3377;What? The culprits must be found!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3378;With each passing year, it seems that the bureaucracy required to keep the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] gets larger and larger. So many of the lord and ladies within your court appear to have greater knowledge of how the bureaucracy works than you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3379;The intrigues within the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] court are many. The latest has come with an offer: [courtier.GetBestName] believes [courtier.GetSheHe] can help you with a vassal who doesn't like you very much, at least for a time. Why [courtier.GetSheHe] wishes to help you, you're not even quite certain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3379;Do what you can;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3379;I don't need help with [problem_vassal.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3380;You weren't even present when it happened: evidently [first_courtier.GetBestName] and [second_courtier.GetBestName] had some kind of argument during court, something which has become increasingly vicious over the last several days as each of them drags more fellow courtiers into their feud. Both have approached you to ask for your support against the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3380;Support [first_courtier.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3380;Support [second_courtier.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_3380;Do not get me involved in this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_3380;I will help them work this out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3381;The imperial court is a living, breathing organ within the palace. Lords and ladies come and go, plotting behind their smiles and doing their best to climb up the social ladder and into your good graces as if you didn't notice their maneuvering to get there. Is this truly what the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] has come to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3382;[guard.GetBestName] has approached you with a proposal to reform the regulations used to raise and train the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] levies. [guard.GetHerHisCap] ideas have a great deal of support within the court, though others say they also have a good chance of going very wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3383;You have always enjoyed a cadre of personal guard to protect your person, but recently [guard.GetBestName] has proven [guard.GetHerHis] loyalty and determination to be the best of them. Indeed, just the other day [guard.GetSheHe] stopped a would-be assassin from entering the palace grounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3383;Well done! I feel safer already;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_3385;A Hero Rises;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3385;With [From.GetHerHis] performance at the Battle of [From.Location.GetName] receiving notice throughout the empire, many are declaring [From.GetBestName] a [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] hero - the sort that tales are told of and, some suggest, the sort who rise to themselves become [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3385;Oh, is that so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3385;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3386;Recently there has been talk within the court of how capable [guard.GetBestName] is. They laud [guard.GetHerHis] martial prowess, and implicit within their whispers is that the [guard.GetManWoman] is a better warrior than you...the sort of warrior who could do great things if [guard.GetSheHe] were to rule the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3386;It had best remain talk, and nothing more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
