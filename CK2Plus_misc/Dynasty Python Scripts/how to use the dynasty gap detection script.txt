First up, you need the latest version of Python 3.
https://www.python.org/downloads/

To use the script, just double click it (after installing Python 3 obviously). It will export the results to a file called gaps.txt (make sure there's no file called gaps.txt in the folder already).
If you want to scan a different file (character files might work as well), just change the file location it reads on line 7 and run it again.

Make sure to open the dynasty files and CTRL-F to make sure the supposed gaps aren't actually there but they were placed in the wrong order. If they are, make sure to loudly complain about Paradox and the Swedes in general on the Paradox Forums.
