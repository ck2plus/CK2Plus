	* Reworked tributary system. The CB is replaced with a targeted decision. The target will respond either by accepting becoming a tributary, rejecting, or offering a deal. If they reject, the attacker can then declare Tributary War, or back out of the whole deal and lose prestige. If attacker is offered a deal (bribe), they can accept the money or, again, go to war. In addition to that, using the tributary action will block tributary decision for a year, or five years in case war was won, or ten years if player chooses the backing out option.
	* Roman province of Pannonia-Dacia
	* Trigger Schism start decision is now a game rule.
	* Empire Creation game rule which regulates how many kingdom titles are required to form an empire. Options are Two and Three.
	* Culture Conversion Law - This law controls the speed and behaviour of culture conversion. It is available to independent feudal kings and emperors. This law does not affect melting pot events. Available laws are:
		- None - Culture conversion is happening at 1/10th of normal speed. Change Province Culture ambition is not available if this law is enacted, and chance of an uprising is reduced 10 times.
		- Passive - Default conversion settings.
		- Active - Culture conversion is hapening at twice the rate. Chance of an uprising is increased two times. Provinces with "wrong" culture will not prosper. Medium or higher CA is required for this law.
