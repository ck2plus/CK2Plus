	* Reworked tributary system. The CB is replaced with a targeted decision. The target will respond either by accepting becoming a tributary, rejecting, or offering a deal. If they reject, the attacker can then declare Tributary War, or back out of the whole deal and lose prestige. If attacker is offered a deal (bribe), they can accept the money or, again, go to war. In addition to that, using the tributary action will block tributary decision for a year, or five years in case war was won, or ten years if player chooses the backing out option.
