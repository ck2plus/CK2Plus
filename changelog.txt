changelog 4.05.0

* In later bookmarks changed the vassal relationship of Russia rulers to the hordes to instead be tributary relationships
* Shuffled the kingdom colours in India around to make them more easily distinguishable
* Added the bookmark "A New Millenium" to the era chooser UI, replacing the 1337 era. The latter can still be chosen as a regular bookmark via "Custom Game Setup"
* Fixed a phantom character appearing in the "High Middle Ages" era

* Rulers with tributaries may now declare war on them for claims, at an extra penalty. You will lose all your tributaries, lose 100 prestige and lose opinion with your vassals. The AI will never make use of this

* Only tribes and nomads may declare war to force a realm to pay tribute
